## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Transaction-Session Continuity** - `read_active_transaction_full()` returns complete transaction data:
  - Session ID from PREFLIGHT is preserved across compaction boundaries
  - POSTFLIGHT auto-resolves session_id from transaction file, preventing stale summary errors

- **Shared Project Resolver** - Canonical `lib/project_resolver.py` for hooks:
  - All hooks now use single source of truth for project resolution
  - Priority chain: `active_work_{claude_session_id}` → `instance_projects/{instance_id}` → NO CWD fallback
  - Eliminates ~120 lines of duplicate resolution logic across sentinel, pre-compact, post-compact hooks

- **Context Budget Manager Events** - Bus integration for memory pressure:
  - `MEMORY_PRESSURE`, `CONTEXT_EVICTED`, `CONTEXT_INJECTED`, `PAGE_FAULT` events
  - Published to EpistemicBus for observer notification

### Changed
- **Sentinel Messages** - Opaque confidence feedback:
  - Blocking messages no longer reveal threshold values or current vectors
  - Prevents AI from gaming the gate by targeting specific numbers

- **Safe Pipe Targets** - Extended read-only whitelist:
  - Added `jq` to SAFE_PIPE_TARGETS for JSON processing during investigation

### Fixed
- **Project ID Consistency** - Session-authoritative project linkage:
  - Both `store_vectors()` and sentinel now use session's `project_id` (UUID) as source
  - Eliminates mismatch when PREFLIGHT stored hash but sentinel computed different hash
  - Fixes "Project context changed" false positive when Claude navigates directories

- **MCP Server Project Resolution** - Session-aware CLI routing:
  - `route_to_cli()` now resolves project path from `session_id` before falling back to CWD
  - Fixes "Project not found" errors when MCP runs from different directory than Claude
  - Noetic artifact logging (finding-log, unknown-log) now finds correct project DB

- **Unified Context Resolver** - Centralized session/transaction/project resolution:
  - Added `get_active_context()` and `update_active_context()` to session_resolver.py
  - Single source of truth for claude_session_id, empirica_session_id, transaction_id, project_path
  - PREFLIGHT now uses unified resolver to update context atomically
  - Sentinel prioritizes transaction file's session_id (survives compaction boundaries)
  - Fixes "loop closed" false positive when transactions span sessions

### Added (continued)
- **Epistemic Transactions** - First-class measurement windows with `transaction_id`:
  - PREFLIGHT→POSTFLIGHT cycles are now discrete measurement transactions
  - Multiple goals can exist within one transaction; one goal can span multiple transactions
  - Transaction boundaries defined by coherence of changes, not by goal boundaries
  - Adds `transaction_id` column to epistemic assessments for precise delta tracking

- **Ecosystem Topology** - Declarative project dependency graph:
  - `ecosystem.yaml` manifest at workspace root (32 projects, 18 dependency edges)
  - `EcosystemGraph` loader with transitive downstream/upstream traversal, impact analysis, validation
  - `empirica ecosystem-check` CLI with 5 modes: summary, file impact, project deps, role/tag filter, validate
  - `workspace-map` enriched with ecosystem role, type, and dependency data per repo

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Parallel investigation with epistemic lineage:
  - `AttentionBudget` for parallel agent token allocation and monitoring
  - Agent generator with persona-derived Claude Code agents
  - `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` lifecycle hooks for epistemic lineage tracking
  - `parent_session_id` schema for sub-agent session hierarchy
  - No-match decomposition and emerged persona promotion

  - Wired into CHECK phase for automatic blind spot surfacing
  - Integrated into MCP server tools

- **Epistemic Tool Router** - Vector-aware skill suggestion:
  - Routes to appropriate tools based on current epistemic state vectors
  - Integrated into MCP `skill_suggest` tool

- **On/Off Toggle** - On-the-record vs off-the-record tracking:
  - `/empirica on|off|status` command for Claude Code plugin
  - Controls sentinel enforcement and epistemic tracking

- **Eidetic Rehydration** - Full Qdrant restore via `project-embed`:
  - Rebuilds eidetic memory from cold storage to search layer

- **Auto-Init Sessions** - `--auto-init` flag on `session-create`:
  - Automatically initializes project if not yet tracked (closes #25)

- **Collaborator Config Sync** - `empirica-collab-sync.sh` script:
  - Syncs breadcrumbs, calibration, and plugin config between collaborators

### Changed
- **Schema Consolidation** - `session_*` tables consolidated into `project_*` as canonical source
- **Sentinel Path Resolution** - Refactored to use canonical `path_resolver` instead of custom logic
- **System Prompts v1.5.0** - CANONICAL_CORE and all model deltas updated:
  - Dual-track calibration (self-referential + grounded verification)
  - Post-test evidence collection triggers automatically on POSTFLIGHT
  - Trajectory tracking across transactions
- **Dynamic Calibration** - Sentinel now uses per-session bias corrections from `.breadcrumbs.yaml`
- **Vocabulary Taxonomy** - Formalized Empirica concept reference and taxonomy in SKILL.md v2.0.0

### Fixed
- **Sentinel Gate Failures** - Dynamic calibration + INVESTIGATE default when gate computation fails

- **Project Init Idempotency** - Prevents orphaned findings on re-initialization
- **Session Instance Isolation** - Respects `instance_id` in auto-close for multi-tmux-pane support
- **Finding Deduplication** - Deduplicates on insert; archives stale plans on session init
- **PREFLIGHT Pattern Retrieval** - Falls back to reasoning when Qdrant unavailable
- **Migration Safety** - Skips migration 021 if engagements table missing; adds client_projects to valid tables

### Security
- **Tiered Sentinel Permissions** - Replaced blanket `empirica` CLI whitelist with role-based permission tiers (read-only, write, admin)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **MCP Multi-Project Support** - MCP server now supports explicit workspace configuration:
  - `--workspace` argument sets project root for multi-project environments
  - Auto-detects from git root if `.empirica/` exists
  - Fallback to common development paths (`~/empirical-ai/empirica`, `~/empirica`)
  - Fixes sessions being created in global `~/.empirica/` instead of project `.empirica/`

### Fixed
- **Sentinel Gate: Empirica CLI** - Allow `empirica` CLI commands with heredocs (stdin JSON input)
- **Sentinel Gate: Stderr Redirects** - Allow safe stderr redirects (`2>/dev/null`, `2>&1`) while still blocking file writes

- **Anti-Gaming Mitigations** - Sentinel detects rushed PREFLIGHT→CHECK transitions (<30s) without investigation evidence
- **Complete Plugin Installer** - One-line curl install for Claude Code integration with all components (hooks, statusline, CLAUDE.md, MCP server)

### Changed
- **Calibration Update** - 2496 observations, updated bias corrections (completion: +0.75, know: +0.17, uncertainty: -0.11)
- **Qdrant Optional** - Memory/semantic search features gracefully handle missing Qdrant; core CASCADE uses SQLite only
- **MCP Tool Mappings** - Added missing tools (session_snapshot, goals_ready, goals_claim, investigate, vision_analyze, edit_with_confidence)
- **MCP Output Limiting** - Responses capped at 30K characters to prevent context overflow

### Fixed

  ```
  - Shows unknowns linked to specific goals
  - Helps identify what's preventing goal completion

- **Statusline Project-Wide Unknowns** - Enhanced statusline shows:
  - Project-wide unknowns with goal-linked blockers
  - Instance-specific active_session files for tmux isolation
  - Upward search for `.empirica/` like git does for `.git/`

- **docs-assess Enhancements** - New flags for documentation assessment:

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Epistemic Investigation** - Spawn parallel investigation agents with different personas to explore codebase corners:
  ```bash
  empirica agent-spawn --session-id <ID> --task "..." --turtle
  ```
  Features:
  - Automatic persona selection with `--turtle` flag
  - Parallel branch execution with POSTFLIGHT aggregation
  - Findings/unknowns automatically logged to parent session

- **Onboarding Projects** - Two complete mini-projects for learning Empirica workflows:
  - `api-explorer/` - Discovery exercise with intentionally incomplete API docs
  - `refactor-decision/` - Decision-making exercise with multiple valid approaches
  - Each includes WALKTHROUGH.md and SOLUTION.md for guided learning

## [1.2.4] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **project-switch Command** - New command for AI agents to switch between projects with clear context banner and automatic bootstrap loading.
  ```bash
  empirica project-switch <project-name-or-id>
  ```
  Features:
  - Resolves projects by name (case-insensitive) or UUID
  - Shows "you are here" context banner with project details
  - Automatically runs project-bootstrap for context loading
  - Displays project status (sessions, flow state, health)
  - Shows next steps (session-create, goals-ready)
  - JSON output support for programmatic use

### Fixed

1. **check-submit Vector Format Handling** - Added robust vector normalization to handle multiple input formats:
   - Flat dictionary: `{engagement: 0.85, know: 0.75, ...}`
   - Structured dictionary: `{foundation: {know, do, context}, comprehension: {...}, execution: {...}}`
   - Wrapped dictionary: `{vectors: {...}}`
   - JSON string inputs (AI-first mode)
   
   Fixes "Vectors must be a dictionary" errors when using structured CASCADE format.
   
2. **agent-spawn Persona Schema Validation** - Fixed validation errors for persona records:
   - PersonaManager.load_persona() now normalizes public_key to valid Ed25519 format (64 hex chars)
   - Auto-fills missing focus_domains with `['general']` for backward compatibility
   - Default persona in epistemic_agent.py now includes focus_domains
   
   Fixes "public_key 'scout_key_placeholder' invalid" and "focus_domains is required property" errors.
   
3. **Findings/Unknowns/Dead-ends Duplication** - Fixed duplicate breadcrumbs in project-bootstrap output:
   - Changed `UNION ALL` to `UNION` in 8 queries across breadcrumbs.py (get_project_findings, get_project_unknowns, get_project_dead_ends)
   - When scope='both', findings were written to both session_findings and project_findings tables
   - UNION automatically deduplicates while preserving dual-scope architecture

### Changed
- docs/PROJECT_SWITCHING_FOR_AIS.md: Updated status from "CRITICAL" to "IMPLEMENTED" with completed checklist items

### Tests
- Added 4 new tests for project-switch command (all passing)
- Total: 281 tests passing

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Epistemic Release Agent** (`empirica release-ready`) - Pre-release verification command with epistemic principles:
  - Version sync check across pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CLAUDE.md prompt version
  - Architecture turtle assessment on core/, cli/, data/ directories
  - PyPI package verification for empirica and empirica-mcp
  - Privacy/security scan for secrets, credentials, and dev files
  - Documentation completeness check (README, CHANGELOG, docs/)
  - Git status verification (branch, uncommitted changes, unpushed commits)
  - Respects .gitignore patterns - only flags items NOT covered by gitignore
  - Moon phase indicators (🌕🌔🌓🌒🌑) for visual status
  - JSON output for CI/automation (`--output json`)
  - Quick mode (`--quick`) to skip architecture assessment

### Fixed
- **Issue Resolution Bug** - `issue-resolve` command was filtering by session_id, preventing resolution of issues from different sessions. Removed session_id constraint from WHERE clause.
- **Goal Completion Bug** - `goals-complete` command returned success but never updated goal status in database. Added missing UPDATE statement to set status='completed'.
- **Ollama Auto-Detection** - Embeddings now auto-detect Ollama availability and use semantic embeddings when available, falling back to local hash when not.
- **Sentinel Auto-Enable** - Sentinel now auto-enables with default epistemic evaluator on module load, appearing in CASCADE responses.

### Changed
- Added `.beads/` and `*.pem` to .gitignore for security
- Reorganized .gitignore with "Security-sensitive files" section

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Flow State Display Slice Error** - Fixed TypeError in project-bootstrap command where flow_data was incorrectly treated as a list when it's actually a dictionary. Changed to properly access flow_metrics['flow_scores']. This was causing "slice(None, 5, None)" error messages in bootstrap output.
- **Missing Flow Metrics Components** - Added 'components' and 'recommendations' fields to flow metrics data structure. Components now show weighted breakdown of flow score factors (engagement, capability, clarity, etc.), and recommendations are generated from identify_flow_blockers().

### Added
- **Auto-Capture Logging Hooks** - Implemented true automatic error capture via Python's logging system:
  - Added `AutoCaptureLoggingHandler` class that hooks into logging.ERROR and logging.CRITICAL
  - Added `install_auto_capture_hooks()` function that installs both logging.Handler and sys.excepthook
  - Integrated into session creation - errors are now captured automatically during CLI execution
  - Captures context (logger name, module, function, line number) for better debugging
  - Non-blocking design - capture errors don't break the application
- Auto-capture now truly "auto" - no explicit calls needed, errors logged anywhere in codebase are captured

### Verified
- JSON output working correctly for project-bootstrap and session-snapshot commands
- Cross-project isolation confirmed with 15 projects
- Dynamic context loading via --depth parameter (minimal/moderate/full/auto)
- Session-optional commands working as documented
- Learning delta calculation accurate in session snapshots

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Schema/API Mismatch in Epistemic Artifacts** - BreadcrumbRepository methods (log_finding, log_unknown, log_dead_end) expected schema columns that were missing from database definitions:
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_findings table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_findings table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_dead_ends table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_dead_ends table
- Impact: Users following system prompt documentation would get immediate SQLite errors when trying to use epistemic artifact tracking
- Testing: Verified with fresh project initialization - all epistemic tracking APIs now work correctly
- This fix enables proper meta-tracking of complex multi-channel projects (e.g., outreach campaigns)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: CHECK GATE confidence threshold bug** - The CHECK command was ignoring explicit confidence values provided by AI agents and instead calculating confidence from uncertainty vectors (1.0 - uncertainty). This prevented the proper enforcement of the ≥0.70 confidence threshold for the CASCADE GATE. Fixed by:
  - Extracting `explicit_confidence` from CHECK input config
  - Using explicit confidence in decision logic when provided
  - Making proceed/investigate decision based on confidence ≥ 0.70 threshold as per system design
  - Keeping drift and unknowns as secondary evidence validation
- **Impact**: All users now have a properly functioning CHECK GATE that respects stated confidence while validating against evidence

### Dogfooding
- Successfully used Empirica's full CASCADE workflow to build these features
- PREFLIGHT → CHECK → POSTFLIGHT assessments captured
- Learning deltas: know +0.13, completion +0.75, uncertainty -0.20
- BEADS integration tested with 3 issues tracked and closed
