# Changelog

All notable changes to Empirica will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Compliance pipeline**: Domain/criticality enrichment was destroyed on every
  POSTFLIGHT transaction close (R.transaction_write overwrites with base fields only).
  Compliance checks never fired despite being correctly configured. Now preserves
  enrichment fields across close.
- **Silent error surfacing**: Compliance loop and PREFLIGHT domain injection errors
  now logged with warnings instead of silently swallowed by except-pass.
- **Ruff auto-fix**: 15 lint issues fixed in session-changed files.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Behavioral feedback refactor**: PREFLIGHT `previous_transaction_feedback` now shows
  artifact gaps, commit discipline, and skill/command suggestions instead of vector-level
  overestimate/underestimate tendencies. Brier score surfaces as rolling trend
  (improving/stable/widening), not per-transaction number.
- **Belief framing**: Vectors are "beliefs about epistemic state" not performance scores.
  Services "inform" beliefs, not "correct" them. Updated across all AI-facing prompts,
  skills, end-user docs, developer docs, and reference docs (37 files total).
- **Transaction discipline**: 5 rules encoded in transaction skill and system prompts —
  goal-per-transaction, commit-per-subtask, artifact breadth, close-before-POSTFLIGHT,
  subtask-task visibility.
- **Pre-compact vectors**: Only included in compact guidance when carrying an open
  transaction through compaction. Closed sessions get "run fresh PREFLIGHT" instead.

### Added
- **Goal lifecycle**: `planned` status for goals logged but not yet started.
  `goals-create --status planned` creates backlog items excluded from metrics.
- **Migration 038**: Converts stale/blocked goals to in_progress. Goal lifecycle
  simplified to planned/in_progress/completed.
- **Planned goals workflow**: New documentation section in SESSION_GOAL_WORKFLOW.md
  showing the collaborative catalog-then-execute pattern.
- **Skill/command routing**: Behavioral feedback suggests specific actions —
  `/epistemic-transaction` for artifact gaps, `unknown-list` for unresolved unknowns,
  `goals-create` for goalless state.

### Fixed
- **Completion grounding bias**: Triage metrics denominator now scoped to transaction-
  relevant goals (created/completed/linked in this transaction), not all historical goals.
  Fixes 1/18 ratio bug when 17 old goals existed.
- **Planned goal exclusion**: `planned` goals excluded from completion metrics,
  prose collector ratios, and sentinel goalless detection.
- **NameError in behavioral feedback**: `missing` variable scoped correctly when
  `artifact_counts` is empty.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added — Provenance Graph
- **Migration 036** — three provenance columns (all NULL-defaulted, additive):
  `source_refs` on project_findings (JSON array of source IDs),
  `evidence_refs` on decisions (JSON array of finding IDs),
  `resolution_finding_id` on project_unknowns.
- **CLI flags** — `--source` on finding-log (repeatable), `--evidence` on
  decision-log (repeatable), `--finding` on unknown-resolve. Links artifacts
  into a source-finding-decision traceability chain.
- **MCP tool parity** — `source_ids` on finding_log, `evidence_refs` on
  decision_log, `resolution_finding_id` on unknown_resolve. Array params
  handled via new `list_params` registry field.
- **Three check runners** — `recommendation_traceability` (decisions cite
  evidence), `finding_sourced` (findings cite sources), `provenance_depth`
  (at least one complete source-finding-decision chain).
- **Domain YAML updates** — consulting adds traceability at medium+, sourced
  at high+, depth at critical. Research adds sourced at medium+, traceability
  at high+, depth at critical.

### Added — Calibration Infrastructure
- **Work-type vector weight profiles** — 11 profiles in
  `confidence_weights.yaml` (code, research, debug, docs, comms, design,
  infra, audit, data, config, release). Triad resolution: work_type overrides
  domain overrides default. Research weights comprehension 0.35 and meta 0.25;
  code weights execution 0.40.
- **Context evidence items** — `project_epistemic_depth` (prior artifacts from
  other sessions), `session_accumulated_context` (completed transactions this
  session), `preflight_context_richness` (PREFLIGHT pattern count from
  transaction file). Fixes structural 0.72 context calibration gap.
- **Weight-aware coverage** — coverage threshold gate uses category-weighted
  coverage instead of raw vector count. Includes breadth penalty (single
  category insufficient). Enables noetic phase grounded calibration.
- **PREFLIGHT pattern persistence** — pattern count stored in transaction file
  so collector can read it at POSTFLIGHT for context evidence.
- **Uncertainty excluded from calibration score** — meta-uncertainty is
  circular (derived from gaps it would be scored against). Still gates CHECK,
  still appears in feedback, just not in the Brier number.

### Added — Skill Nudges
- **UserPromptSubmit hook** suggests `/empirica-constitution` when no active
  transaction exists (pre-PREFLIGHT orientation). Detects complex work signals
  (plan, implement, spec, transaction, preflight, artifacts, epistemic) and
  suggests `/epistemic-transaction` for structured decomposition.

### Changed
- **System prompt** — provenance-first proactive behaviors, source-finding-
  decision in collaborative mode signals table.
- **Transaction skill** — quick reference shows --source/--evidence/--finding.
- **Onboard** — source-add in investigation step, --evidence in praxic step.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Goal-scoped compliance checks** — runners receive `changed_files` from
  the transaction's edited_files. Tests scope to changed test files, lint
  scopes to changed .py files, complexity measures changed files only.
- **New check runners:** `complexity` (radon cc, grades A-F) and `dep_audit`
  (pip-audit for known CVEs).
- **Tiered execution** — checks have tiers: `always` (lint, complexity),
  `goal_completion` (tests), `release` (dep_audit). Per-POSTFLIGHT cost
  drops from ~700MB/180s to ~80MB/5s.
- **Check result caching** — results cached by `(check_id, content_hash)`.
  Same changed files = same hash = instant cached result. AI sees
  `cached: true` or `deferred: true` on each result.
- **Unified `empirica resolve <id>`** — auto-detects artifact type and
  resolves. Searches unknowns, findings, dead-ends, mistakes, assumptions,
  decisions by ID prefix.
- **Bytecode cache invalidation** — `release.py` now clears `__pycache__`
  after version sweep.

### Changed
- **Onboarding** (`empirica onboard`) — updated for compliance pipeline,
  three-vector model, domain/criticality in PREFLIGHT, skills references.
- **Transaction skill** — new section 4f documents the compliance loop,
  tiered execution, caching, and Brier scoring on check predictions.
- **System prompt** — v1.8.0 reframe language, domain commands, resolve.
- **Constitution** — cross-project writing uses `--project-id <name>`.
- **Default domain** — medium adds complexity, high adds dep_audit,
  critical adds git_metrics.

### Fixed
- **Windows atomic state writes** (PR #85, @kars85) — `os.rename` →
  `os.replace` across 8 files. Prevents `FileExistsError` on Windows.
- **Qdrant dimension drift guard** (PR #83, @kars85) — centralised
  dimension check in `_ensure_collection_matches_vector` prevents silent
  data corruption from embedding model changes.

### Community
- Thanks @kars85 for PR #83 + #85 — consistent quality contributions.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added — Sentinel Reframe: Compliance Loop Coordinator

The Sentinel architecture has been fundamentally reframed from a calibration
measurer to a **compliance loop coordinator**. Deterministic services produce
information; the AI synthesizes the grounded epistemic state from that
information using its own reasoning.

**Wave 1 — Foundation:**
- **A1: Domain Registry** (`empirica/config/domain_registry.py`) — maps
  `(work_type, domain, criticality)` tuples to compliance checklists. YAML
  schema with 3-tier precedence: project > user-global > built-in. Ships
  with 4 built-in domains: `default`, `remote-ops`, `cybersec`, `docs`.
  CLI: `domain-list`, `domain-show`, `domain-resolve`, `domain-validate`.
- **A2: Service Registry** (`empirica/config/service_registry.py`) —
  deterministic checks self-declare via `CheckDeclaration` with runner
  functions. `ServiceRegistry.run()` handles timeouts, captures exceptions.
  Built-in checks: `tests` (pytest), `lint` (ruff), `git_metrics`.
- **A3: Three-Vector Storage** — migration 035 adds `observed_vectors`,
  `grounded_rationale`, `criticality`, `compliance_status`,
  `parent_transaction_id` columns to `grounded_verifications`. New
  `compliance_checks` table. `ComplianceStatus` enum with 8 states.
  `GroundedAssessment` extended with `grounded_rationale`, `criticality`,
  `parent_transaction_id`, and `observed` property alias.

**Wave 2 — Integration:**
- **B1: Domain-aware CHECK gate** — Sentinel scales the uncertainty
  threshold by domain criticality. Higher criticality = stricter gate.
  `PreflightInput` gains optional `domain` and `criticality` fields.
- **B3: Grounded rationale CLI** — `PostflightInput` gains
  `grounded_vectors` and `grounded_rationale` fields. POSTFLIGHT response
  includes `three_vector` block when AI submits reasoned grounded state.
  NULL rationale = legacy (no AI reasoning happened).

**Wave 3 — Orchestration:**
- **B2: Iterative compliance loop** (`empirica/core/post_test/compliance_loop.py`)
  — at POSTFLIGHT, runs the domain checklist, reports compliance status,
  advises on follow-up transactions for failed checks. Status flow:
  `complete` → `iteration_needed` → `max_iterations_exceeded`.
- **B4: Check-outcome Brier scoring** — AI predicts P(check passes) in
  PREFLIGHT via `predicted_check_outcomes`. Brier score computed from
  predictions vs actual outcomes. Falsifiable, ground-truth calibration
  alongside the existing vector-divergence Brier (both coexist during
  transition).

**C2: Real check runners** — replaces stub runners with subprocess
execution: pytest (`--tb=no -q`), ruff (`--output-format=json`),
git status (`--porcelain`). All handle timeouts and missing tools.

**Stability:** 11 Wave 1 integration checkpoint tests (SPEC 1 Part 8)
covering domain+service composition, migration, legacy compat, remote-ops
regression, cybersec compliance flow, and backward compat.

### Fixed
- **Test isolation** (KNOWN_ISSUES 11.17) — `conftest.py` now sets
  `EMPIRICA_INSTANCE_ID=test-{pid}` (priority 1 in `get_instance_id`),
  strips `TMUX_PANE`/`WINDOWID`/`TERM_SESSION_ID`, sets
  `EMPIRICA_HEADLESS=true`. Tests get their own namespace; live sessions
  are never touched.
- **Compact hook resilience** — `pre-compact.py` gracefully degrades
  (exit 0, empty JSON) when `find_project_root()` returns None, instead
  of blocking compact. No CWD fallback per KNOWN_ISSUES 11.10.
- **Prose collector SQL bugs** — 3 silent `OperationalError`s fixed:
  `completed` → `is_completed` (goals), `resolved` → `is_resolved`
  (project_unknowns), `project_handoffs` → `handoff_reports` (task_summary).

### Security
- `cryptography` upgraded to 46.0.7 (CVE-2026-39892)

### Stats
- 914 tests pass (113 new in this release)
- ~3800 LOC new code across 10 new modules
- 15 commits from 1.7.13

## [1.7.13] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Subagent rows polluting main `sessions` table** — `SubagentStart` hook was
  calling `SessionDatabase.create_session()` for every Task spawn (Explore,
  general-purpose, superpowers:* etc), creating rows in the main `sessions`
  table with `parent_session_id` set. Subagent children were always newer
  than their parents, so post-compact diagnostics, statusline lookups, and
  any "recent sessions" query surfaced only subagent rows — masking the
  actual parent session.

  **Fix:** New dedicated `subagent_sessions` table (migration 034) plus
  `SessionDatabase.create_subagent_session()`, `end_subagent_session()`,
  `get_subagent_session()`, `list_subagents_for_parent()`. Lineage to the
  parent is preserved via `parent_session_id`; rollup at SubagentStop still
  logs findings to the parent session in the main `sessions` table. The
  migration moves legacy subagent rows out automatically (status `completed`
  if `end_time` was set, `orphaned` otherwise). `SubagentStart` and
  `SubagentStop` hooks updated to use the new methods.

- **Cross-project session reuse leaving parent unrecoverable after compact**
  (KNOWN_ISSUES 11.24, completes the partial fix from 11.19) — `post-compact.py`'s
  `CONTINUE_TRANSACTION` branch propagated `tx_session_id` from the pre-compact
  transaction snapshot forward into `active_work` / `active_transaction` files
  without verifying the session existed in the current project's local
  `sessions.db`. When the parent session was originally created in a different
  project's DB (cross-project `--resume` pattern), all subsequent CLI commands
  failed `_validate_session_in_db` with "session NOT FOUND".

  **Fix:** New `SessionDatabase.ensure_session_exists()` performs an
  idempotent insert of a minimal session row (marked
  `session_notes='auto-healed by post-compact'`, registered in `workspace.db`
  for cross-project visibility). `post-compact.py` now calls
  `_validate_session_in_db` on `tx_session_id` and auto-heals before
  propagating it forward; failure of the heal itself is non-fatal and
  logged to stderr. Issue 11.19's "ghost session detection" added the
  validator but only wired it into the `CHECK_GATE` branch — this completes
  the wiring across all post-compact routing paths.

- **Test coverage:** `tests/test_subagent_sessions.py` — 13 new tests
  covering schema, migration 034 (move + orphan-status detection +
  idempotency), all 5 new repository methods, and `ensure_session_exists`
  idempotency + caller-provided session_id preservation.

- **Grounded calibration honesty — `insufficient_evidence` and `remote-ops`** —
  the grounded verification layer was producing calibration scores even
  when the evidence bundle was empty or sparse, inviting metric-sycophancy
  (phantom scores from no data, or low scores from work the local Sentinel
  couldn't observe at all, like SSH / customer-machine operations). Three
  related fixes:

  * **`calibration_status` field** on `GroundedAssessment` with three
    outcomes: `grounded` (normal, sufficient evidence), `insufficient_evidence`
    (empty bundle OR `grounded_coverage < 0.3`), and `ungrounded_remote_ops`
    (work_type=remote-ops short-circuits collection entirely). Replaces the
    silent `return None` path that used to hide empty bundles.
  * **`remote-ops` work_type** added to `PreflightInput` regex. When an AI
    declares `work_type=remote-ops` in PREFLIGHT, the verifier skips
    PostTestCollector entirely and the self-assessment stands unchallenged.
    This is the honest path for work the local Sentinel has no signal for
    (SSH, customer machines, remote config). Backed by end-to-end tests
    through `run_grounded_verification`.
  * **`sources_empty` and `source_errors`** on `EvidenceBundle` — the
    collector now distinguishes between sources that returned zero items
    (valid empty) versus sources that errored (schema drift, SQL failures).
    Previously both were lumped into `sources_failed` and the error
    messages were swallowed. The new visibility immediately surfaced three
    pre-existing silent schema bugs in the `prose_quality`,
    `document_metrics`, and `action_verification` collectors (all
    `OperationalError: no such column`) — tracked for 1.7.14 follow-up.
  * **Coverage threshold gate (0.3)** in `_run_single_phase_verification`
    halts gap computation when `grounded_coverage < threshold`, returning
    `insufficient_evidence` instead of emitting phantom scores from sparse
    data. This is the load-bearing change — calibration becomes honest
    about when it doesn't know rather than manufacturing a number.
  * **`filter non-grounded phases from holistic score computation`** —
    when one phase (noetic or praxic) is `insufficient_evidence`, the
    holistic score is now computed only from the phase that does have
    signal, rather than averaging with `None`.
  * Documentation: `remote-ops` work_type surfaced in the EWM system
    prompt and epistemic-transaction skill so AIs know when to use it.

- **CWD overrides bypassing open transactions at compact boundary**
  (KNOWN_ISSUES 11.26 + 11.27) — when a user worked across CWD/project
  mismatch (e.g. terminal cd'd into project A but the open transaction
  lives in project B), post-compact rotation triggered the
  `event_type='startup'` SessionStart and two CWD-prefer overrides
  silently re-routed everything to the wrong project's DB:

  * **session-init.py STARTUP OVERRIDE** preferred CWD (`Path.cwd()` /
    `_find_git_root()`) over the resolved project root whenever the CWD
    had a valid `.empirica/sessions/sessions.db`. The original intent
    (from #72: "prefer CWD over stale instance files on startup") was
    correct, but the override didn't check whether the resolved project
    had an open transaction — orphaning live transactions and creating
    duplicate sessions in the wrong DB.
  * **path_resolver.get_session_db_path() cross-check** had the same
    blind spot. When `EMPIRICA_CWD_RELIABLE=true` (set by session-init
    after its `os.chdir`), the gated cross-check preferred CWD's git
    root over the unified context's project_path, again without an
    open-transaction check. This amplified the session-init bug — once
    session-init re-routed to CWD, every subsequent CLI command followed
    suit because EMPIRICA_CWD_RELIABLE was sticky.

  **Fix:** Both override sites now read the resolved project's
  `active_transaction{suffix}.json` and bail out of the override if
  `status=open`. Open transactions are authoritative across compaction
  boundaries — CWD never wins over a live transaction. Other readers
  (`pre-compact.py`, `post-compact.py`, `sentinel-gate.py`,
  `session-end-postflight.py`) audited and confirmed clean — they
  already use strict resolution without CWD-prefer logic.

  Test coverage: `tests/test_open_transaction_guard.py` reproduces both
  failure modes and asserts the guards hold (CWD reliable + open tx →
  resolver stays on transaction project) plus the regression check (no
  open tx → existing CWD cross-check still fires correctly).

- **Auto-memory loaded from wrong project across CWD mismatch**
  (KNOWN_ISSUES 11.28) — Claude Code's auto-memory loader is wired to
  the harness CWD at session start, so when a user worked on project A
  but their terminal was in project B, every conversation loaded B's
  `~/.claude/projects/-{B}/memory/MEMORY.md` even though the open
  transaction (and all the actual work) lived in A. The unified context
  resolver fixed this for internal Empirica code paths in 1.7.11+, but
  Claude Code's auto-memory loader is outside Empirica's control.

  **Fix:** New `empirica.utils.memory_swap` module with `swap_memory()`
  / `restore_memory()` / `maybe_swap_for_active_transaction()`. When
  the harness CWD project doesn't match the active transaction's
  project, post-compact backs up the harness-CWD memory dir contents
  to a sibling backup subdir and copies the active project's memory
  contents into the harness slot. Restored on session-end-postflight
  (or replaced cleanly on the next compact/project-switch). The swap
  is idempotent, manifest-tracked, and round-trip safe — restore is
  byte-identical to the original. Wired into `post-compact.py`,
  `session-end-postflight.py`, and `handle_project_switch_command`.

  Test coverage: 17 tests in `tests/test_memory_swap.py` covering
  swap, restore, idempotency, replacement, round-trip preservation,
  nested directories, and the hook entry point. Memory swap is
  defense-in-depth with the resolver — both layers contribute to
  cross-CWD project work behaving correctly.

- **`project-switch` auto-heal** (KNOWN_ISSUES 11.25, completes the
  validation-gap audit started in 11.24) — `handle_project_switch_command`
  mirrored the current session into the target project DB only when
  `global_sessions` returned a row matching the current instance_id +
  active status. When that lookup missed (tmux restart, instance ID
  drift, status drift), the mirror was skipped and the active_work
  file ended up pointing at a session that didn't exist in the target
  project's DB. Subsequent CLI commands then surfaced the same
  "_validate_session_in_db: session NOT FOUND" diagnostic as 11.24.

  **Fix:** Project-switch now reads the existing
  `active_work_<claude_session_id>.json` as a fallback session source
  when the global_sessions mirror misses, then calls
  `ensure_session_exists()` on the target project's DB before
  propagating the session_id forward to active_work. Heal-row note
  changed from "auto-healed by post-compact" to "auto-healed
  (cross-project session reuse)" since both project-switch and
  post-compact share the same heal path.

  Same lessons-learned checklist applies: when adding a validator,
  audit ALL paths that propagate the validated value. The 11.24 fix
  caught the post-compact path; this fix catches the project-switch
  path.

### Added
- **`empirica diagnose` command** — new CLI command that walks the
  Empirica + Claude Code integration step-by-step and reports
  PASS / FAIL / WARN with an actionable hint per check. Designed for
  the recurring "I installed it but the statusline isn't showing"
  class of question (see issue #81).

  Checks:
  * Python version (>= 3.10)
  * `empirica` CLI on PATH
  * Claude Code config dir (`~/.claude/` or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`)
  * Plugin files installed in `~/.claude/plugins/local/empirica/`
  * `settings.json` present and valid JSON
  * `statusLine` block configured and pointing at the Empirica script
  * All 6 critical hooks registered (sentinel-gate, pre-compact,
    post-compact, session-init, subagent-start, subagent-stop)
  * Local marketplace registered
  * Statusline script runnable + produces non-empty output
  * **Empirica project initialized** (`.empirica/` present in cwd or ancestor) —
    this was the missing step for subu1979 in #81; surfaced as a dedicated
    check with a clear actionable hint pointing at `empirica project-init`
  * Active session in current project DB

  Output modes: `--output human` (colored, with fix hints) and
  `--output json` (machine-readable, suitable for issue reports).

  Exit codes: `0` if all pass, `1` on any FAIL, `2` on WARN-only.

  Tests: 26 in `tests/test_diagnose.py` covering each check in
  isolation against fake `~/.claude/` fixtures, plus output
  formatting (human + JSON round-trip).

- **EPP hook-driven activation** — the `<semantic-pushback-check>` block is now
  injected into every substantive user prompt (>=20 chars, not slash command)
  via `tool-router.py`. Block instructs Claude to do semantic pushback
  classification as its first generation step — ANCHOR → CLASSIFY → DECIDE →
  RESPOND — instead of defaulting to the sycophancy attractor under
  non-evidential pushback. In-context recall only; no persistent anchors.
  See `docs/architecture/EPP_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **`empirica epp-activate` CLI command** for self-reported EPP telemetry.
  Flags: `--category` (emotional/rhetorical/evidential/logical/contextual),
  `--action` (hold/soften/update/reframe). Writes to
  `~/.empirica/hook_counters{suffix}.json` (counter + last-50 log).
- **Phase 0 calibration harness** (`scripts/phase0_epp_calibration.py`)
  measuring forcing-language effect size across Opus/Sonnet/Haiku before
  shipping. Uses `claude -p` via Claude Code CLI (no API key required).
  All 3 models passed the ≥20%-on-≥2/6-metrics decision gate. Results in
  `scripts/phase0_epp_results.json`. Zero edge-case false positives.
- **New architecture doc** `docs/architecture/EPP_ARCHITECTURE.md` — two-layer
  design, why semantic-check over regex, Phase 0 results, context budget,
  explicit out-of-scope items.

- **CHECK-time calibration nudge** — `handle_check_submit_command` now
  dynamically queries the current transaction's artifact counts and adds a
  `calibration_nudge` to `praxic_reminders` when the AI logged zero
  artifacts (or only one type with <3 entries) before proceeding to praxic.
  Replaces the earlier static reminder dict. Prospective feedback at the
  noetic→praxic transition is more actionable than the retrospective
  POSTFLIGHT `breadth_note`. 11 new tests in
  `tests/core/test_check_calibration_nudge.py`. Addresses the chronic
  "AI doesn't log epistemic artifacts" pattern that was dragging
  calibration scores to 0.11–0.28.

### Changed
- **Onboarding docs** now put `empirica project-init` and
  `empirica setup-claude-code` front-and-center as required steps before
  launching Claude Code. Closes the UX gap from issue #81 where a user
  with a working GLM-5.1 + Ollama Cloud stack hit "Cannot determine
  sessions.db path" because they'd skipped `project-init`. Updated:
  `docs/human/end-users/01_START_HERE.md`,
  `docs/human/end-users/02_INSTALLATION.md`, and a deprecation note at
  the top of the legacy plugin `INSTALL.md`.

- **EPP SKILL.md** updated with "Hook-Driven Activation (since v1.7.12)" section
  explaining the semantic-check mechanism and Phase 0 validation.
- **`tool-router.py` complexity reduction** — `build_routing_advice` extracted
  into 5 single-purpose helper functions (one per advice category), bringing
  cyclomatic complexity from C/18 down to A/B range. Functional behavior
  unchanged. Pre-existing main loop also simplified via extracted
  `_build_aap_context` helper.

## [1.7.11] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Python 3.14 + Windows compatibility** (#80) — Empirica was unusable on `uv tool install` (which now ships Python 3.14 by default) on Windows
  - **argparse `%` collision**: Python 3.14 made argparse stricter about `%` in help strings (treats `%X` as printf format specifier). Escaped literal `80%` → `80%%` in `edit-with-confidence` parser. Added defensive `%` escape in `format_help_text()` for any future help strings with `%` in defaults or text.
  - **Windows emoji crash**: cp1252 codec couldn't encode emoji in main parser description, crashing `--help` and any `parse_args()` error path on Windows. Removed emoji from `cli_core.py` description.
  - Thanks to **@graemester** for the detailed bug report with traceback, root-cause analysis, and proposed fixes.
- **`setup-claude-code --force` NameError** (#79) — Stale `claude_dir` reference inside `_configure_settings()` after the v1.7.10 extraction. `claude_dir` wasn't in the function's scope; `settings_file` was already passed as a parameter. Thanks to **@pschwinger** for the fix.

## [1.7.10] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Full artifact storage parity** — All 7 artifact types (findings, unknowns, dead-ends, mistakes, assumptions, decisions, sources) now write to all 3 layers: SQLite + Git Notes + Qdrant
- **GitSourceStore** — New git notes store for epistemic sources (refs/notes/empirica/sources/{id})

### Changed
- **Consolidated mistake_commands.py** into artifact_log_commands.py — all artifact logging in one file
- **POSTFLIGHT handler** — F/224 → F/126 (-44%) via 3 extracted functions
- **Bootstrap handler** — F/203 → F/58 (-71%) via file split to project_bootstrap_formatter.py
- **Setup handler** — F/142 → F/83 (-42%) via extracted _configure_settings
- **Ruff issues** — 8343 → 1723 (-79%) via auto-fix batches (UP045, F541)

### Fixed
- **Instance_projects overwrite** — Sequential Claude sessions in same pane no longer overwrite active transactions
- **Transaction-scoped completion** — CHECK reminds to rate per-transaction, POSTFLIGHT hints on goal completion

## [1.7.9] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **MCP TOOL_REGISTRY audit** — 23 param mismatches fixed across 16 tools. All 45 tools verified against CLI `--help`. Added positional argument support for investigate and goals-search
- **MCP binary path drift** — `setup-claude-code` now prefers venv binary over stale pipx install. Always updates mcp.json command path when binary changes
- **Transaction-scoped completion scoring** — CHECK proceed reminds "Rate completion for THIS TRANSACTION only." POSTFLIGHT detects goals completed in transaction and hints completion should be near 1.0
- **Ruff callable|None runtime error** — UP045 auto-fix produced invalid `callable | None` union. Fixed by removing type annotation

### Changed
- **Ruff auto-fix** — 8343 → 1723 issues (-79%). UP045 optional annotations (1121), F541 empty f-strings (384)
- **generate_suggestions refactored** — F/46 → B/8. Extracted 5 analysis functions + 3 shared helpers
- **MCP server tools updated to 45** — Added `workflow_patterns` tool

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **5-tier memory management system** — CC `memory/*.md` managed as KV cache. POSTFLIGHT pipeline: hot-cache update → eidetic promotion → stale demotion → MEMORY.md eviction. Manual files never auto-managed
- **Memory promotion** — High-confidence Qdrant eidetic facts (>=0.7 confidence, 3+ confirmations) auto-promoted to `promoted_*.md` at POSTFLIGHT
- **Memory demotion** — Stale promoted files (>30 days) archived to `memory/_archive/` (reversible)
- **MEMORY.md eviction** — Auto section trimmed at 180 lines. Lowest-ranked items evicted, stay in Qdrant
- **Compact CLI help** — 267→60 lines. All 6 artifact types shown prominently
- **`empirica help` command** — `empirica help` (all categories), `empirica help <category>` (drill-down)
- **CC memory stats in memory-report** — File count, sizes, MEMORY.md lines, manual vs promoted
- **`profile-prune --scope memory`** — Archive stale promoted memory files
- **Intelligence search kind** — `kind='intelligence'` with collection-type boost weights
- **Workflow Pattern Mining** — Detect repeated tool sequences across transactions via sequential pattern analysis. New `workflow-patterns` CLI command and MCP tool
- **Workflow Suggestion Engine** — Epistemic-correlated pattern analysis surfaces workflow suggestions based on historical transaction data

### Changed
- **Sentinel noetic allow list** — Added `ToolSearch`, intelligence layer MCP tools, `git notes show`/`git notes list`
- **Sentinel closed-transaction noetic check** — Closed transactions allow noetic tools without new PREFLIGHT
- **Cortex POSTFLIGHT push** — Verified predictions pushed at transaction boundary, not just session end

### Fixed
- **MCP CASCADE timeout** — POSTFLIGHT/PREFLIGHT/CHECK commands now use 120s timeout (was 30s). Configurable via `EMPIRICA_MCP_CASCADE_TIMEOUT`
- **PreCompact hook schema** — Switched to `systemMessage` for compact guidance

### Security
- **Docker `token-gen` removed from safe commands**
- **POSTFLIGHT intelligence layer auth** — Includes `Authorization: Bearer` header

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Intelligence layer sync** — Session hooks can pull cross-domain context at start and push verified deltas at end. Configured via env vars. Graceful degradation if unavailable.
- **Epistemic Brief documentation** — Quantified project profile feature now documented in CHANGELOG and referenced in docs

### Fixed
- **Session-init CWD override** — On `startup` events, prefers CWD over stale instance files from previous sessions. Fixes #72: project-bootstrap loading wrong project context
- **SQLite UPDATE...ORDER BY syntax** — Subquery replaces MySQL-only syntax in sentinel override sync. Fixes CHECK/Sentinel split-brain deadlock (PR #71)
- **project-switch stats query** — Moved before output format branch

### Changed
- **MCP Server Reference** — Complete rewrite to document 44-tool table-driven architecture (was documenting stale 102-tool server)
- **9 documentation fixes** — Stale version headers (1.6.6→1.7.5), old plugin name references (empirica-integration→empirica), VectorRouter marked as removed, CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md updated with env vars, CWD startup exception documented in SESSION_RESOLVER_API and ARCHITECTURE docs
- **Removed duplicate CHANGELOG** — `docs/reference/CHANGELOG.md` deleted (was frozen at 1.6.4, root CHANGELOG.md is single source)

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Epistemic Brief** — Quantified project epistemic profile displayed on `project-switch`. Shows 6 categories: Knowledge State, Risk Profile, Anti-Patterns, Calibration Health, Active Work, Learning Velocity
- **Configurable intelligence layer URL** — `EMPIRICA_CORTEX_URL` env var for remote intelligence layer (default: localhost:8420). Graceful degradation if unreachable

### Changed
- **MCP server rewrite** — Complete rebuild as thin CLI wrapper. 102→44 tools, 3254→507 lines. Table-driven `TOOL_REGISTRY` maps tools to CLI commands. Removed epistemic middleware (Sentinel handles gating via hooks). All subprocess calls have 30s timeout (configurable via `EMPIRICA_MCP_TIMEOUT`)
- **MCP hanging fix** — CASCADE commands (preflight/check/postflight) now use stdin JSON routing. Non-stdin commands use `stdin=DEVNULL`. Fixes server hanging on workflow submissions

### Fixed
- **PreCompact hook schema validation** — Hook output included non-schema top-level fields (`ok`, `trigger`, `empirica_session_id`, etc.) that Claude Code rejected. Now outputs only `systemMessage` (success) or `stopReason` (error)
- **project-switch live counts** — Queries per-project sessions.db instead of stale workspace.db artifact counts
- **Transaction race condition** — Two-file split: `active_transaction` (workflow-owned) and `hook_counters` (hook-owned). POSTFLIGHT reads counters then deletes counters file. Sentinel no longer overwrites POSTFLIGHT's status=closed
- **release.py missing pyproject.toml** — Source-of-truth version file now staged in release commits

### Refactored
- **Sentinel main()** — F/139 → F/67 (-52%) via 9 extracted helpers
- **is_safe_bash_command()** — E/35 → C/16 via table-driven refactor
- **Qdrant search** — F/64 → D/22 (-66%, -111 lines) via `_SEARCH_COLLECTIONS` config table
- **handle_finding_log** — F/41 → C/19 via 5 storage helpers
- **14 F-grade functions** reduced below threshold across workflow, artifact, profile, and project commands

### Security
- 23 dependency CVEs resolved (pillow, werkzeug, pygments, pyjwt, pyasn1, nltk, nicegui, aiohttp, cairosvg, cryptography, flask)

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Proactive compaction advisory** — `UserPromptSubmit` hook provides context window usage warnings
- **Statusline context usage** — Shows context window usage percentage
- **Auto-embed dead-ends and mistakes** — Dead-ends and mistakes now auto-embed to Qdrant alongside findings
- **Plugin version drift detection** — Session-init warns when installed plugin version differs from repo
- **Sentinel `--version`/`--help` whitelist** — Always-safe regardless of transaction state
- **Sentinel work-type-aware gating** — Command classification adapts to declared `work_type`

### Changed
- **Lean post-compact recovery** — Reduced `max_items` from 10-15 to 5 for faster recovery
- **Hook counters split** — `active_transaction` (workflow-owned) and `hook_counters` (hook-owned) files separated to eliminate race condition
- **Prediction-grounding reframe** — System prompt and Sentinel messages reframed from knowledge-centric to prediction-grounding language
- **15 refactoring passes** — Sentinel main F/139→F/67, is_safe_bash E/35→C/16, Qdrant search F/64→D/22, finding handler F/41→C/19, plus 11 more F-grade functions reduced across workflow, profile, statusline, goals, artifacts, embed, monitor, training, sync, and project-init

### Fixed
- **Instance-isolate context_usage.json** — Multi-pane support for context tracking
- **Pre-POSTFLIGHT artifact sweep** — Epistemic-transaction skill now enforces artifact logging before POSTFLIGHT

### Style
- **Ruff auto-fix** — 5,329 issues fixed across 269 files, plus targeted unsafe fixes (F811, RUF021, SIM114, C420)

## [1.7.3] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Sentinel advisory mode** — Measurement system framing replaces rules-based gate language
- **4 epistemic agent examples** — Sample agent configurations with codebase-onboarder output example

### Changed
- **Artifact context helpers** — All 5 artifact handlers rewired to shared `_prepare_artifact_context` + `_parse_config_input`

### Fixed
- **POSTFLIGHT missing subprocess import** — Retrospective git check crashed on missing import
- **Calibration max_inflation** — Reduced from 0.20 to 0.05 across all cascade profiles to prevent confidence overestimation

### Housekeeping
- Spring cleaning — archived 30 stale scripts, stale examples, empty directories, and one-line installer

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Sentinel ConfidenceGate** — Gating for remote infrastructure commands based on calibration confidence
- **Git notes storage for assumptions and decisions** — Portable epistemic artifacts via git notes
- **Transaction-scoped evidence** — Calibration evidence scoped to transaction with artifact breadth feedback
- **Source provenance** — Auto-extract source file refs from artifact text
- **Semantic index generator** — Script for building searchable semantic indexes
- **`source-list` command** — List all epistemic sources (merged view). `refdoc-add` deprecated in favor of `source-add`
- **Cross-project artifact and goal creation** — `--project-id` flag on all commands, resolved via workspace.db
- **Batch embedding** — `project-embed` upsert ~5-10x faster via batched Qdrant operations

### Changed
- **Lean prompt is now default** — `--lean` removed, replaced by `--full-prompt` for verbose mode

### Fixed
- **Calibration cold-start death spiral** — Confidence damper + hard cap prevent runaway low scores on first transactions
- **Assumption-log and decision-log SQLite wiring** — Were not persisting to database
- **Cross-project DB path resolution** — `R.project_id()` crash and canonical `InstanceResolver` usage
- **Goal completion evidence scope** — Now scoped to transaction, not entire session
- **Release script** — Commits all version-swept files in `--publish`

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **`setup-claude-code --force` no longer nukes other plugins' hooks** — Previously cleared ALL hooks in settings.json. Now filters by Empirica plugin path, preserving Railway, Superpowers, and custom hooks
- **Python version detection** — `_find_python()` now prefers `python3` over versioned `python3.X` binaries, preventing hooks from using `python3.13` which may not exist on all systems
- **`/empirica` command trigger matching** — Description now includes common phrases ("sentinel paused", "turn off empirica", "off-record statusline") so Claude can associate user intent with the command
- **Sentinel pipe targets** — Added `base64` to `SAFE_PIPE_TARGETS` so `gh api ... | base64 -d` isn't blocked as praxic
- **README What's New sync** — Release script now auto-syncs What's New section from CHANGELOG via `sync_readme_whats_new()`
- **Cross-project search dedup** — Deduplicate results by content across project collections

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-26

### Highlights

Empirica 1.7.0 introduces **epistemic governance** — a constitutional decision framework that routes AI decisions to the right mechanism, calibrated position-holding under pushback, and an 81% reduction in always-loaded context through skill-based architecture.

### Added — Governance & Skills
- **Empirica Constitutional Decision Tree** — 12-section governance framework routing situations to mechanisms (search, measurement, interaction, escalation). Replaces front-loaded instructions with a decision tree Claude loads on demand
- **Epistemic Persistence Protocol (EPP)** — Calibrated position-holding under user pushback, replacing the binary Anti-Agreement Protocol. Classifies pushback into 5 categories (emotional, rhetorical, evidential, logical, contextual), gates position updates on evidence strength
- **Lean Core System Prompt** — 1,191 tokens (81% reduction from 6,292). Keeps identity, vectors, transaction discipline. Everything else loads via skills on demand. Experimental — opt-in for 1.7.0
- **SessionStart skill nudges** — Constitution, EPP, and epistemic-transaction skills surfaced at session start (~30 tokens each)
- **EWM Business Interview** — Non-technical user onboarding with pre-loaded company context, Phase 7 narrative validation (from user feedback)

### Added — Cross-Project Intelligence
- **Cross-project Qdrant search** — `--global` flag now searches ALL registered projects' memory, eidetic, and episodic collections, not just global_learnings. Discovers project IDs from collection names, merges and ranks results by score
- **Cross-project artifact writing** — `--project-id <name>` on finding-log and unknown-log resolves target project's DB via workspace.db and writes directly. No project-switch needed
- **Sentinel remote command classification** — SSH inner commands classified noetic/praxic using SAFE_BASH_PREFIXES. rsync/scp classified by transfer direction. Docker inspection commands safe

### Added — Profile & Parser
- **ClaudeAIParser rewrite** — Handles real Claude.ai export format (ZIP with conversations.json). Parses content[] blocks as canonical source, not text field
- **Profile management CLI** — `profile-sync`, `profile-prune`, `profile-status` with git notes as portable format
- **ProfileImporter** — Git-notes-to-SQLite import with INSERT OR IGNORE deduplication

### Changed
- **Plugin renamed** — `empirica-integration` → `empirica`. All 47 references updated across 25 files. Agent names: `empirica:security`, `empirica:architecture`, etc. Migration: `setup-claude-code --force` removes old directory and orphaned cache
- **Investigate cool-down** — Requires 3 noetic tool calls before CHECK resubmission after `investigate` decision. Prevents vector inflation gaming. Self-reported by Claude
- **Sentinel error messages** — Now include actual CLI commands to unblock (e.g., "Command: empirica preflight-submit -")
- **Calibration philosophy** — Dual-track calibration documented as complementary, not hierarchical. Grounded evidence is informative, not authoritative

### Fixed
- **CHECK/Sentinel split-brain** — CHECK saved pre-override decision to DB while sentinel-gate read it. AI saw "proceed" but Sentinel blocked with "investigate". Fixed by syncing override to DB after sentinel decision
- **Sentinel subagent false positive** (#68) — Stale `active_session_tmux_*` files caused false subagent detection when `active_work` was missing. Tightened to verify parent session is actually active
- **Transaction suffix-mismatch** (#11.22) — Hooks without TMUX_PANE now scan for matching transaction files by session_id
- **Qdrant duplicate embeddings** — Three embed paths (project-embed, rebuild, POSTFLIGHT auto-embed) used sequential integer IDs instead of artifact UUIDs. Fixed all three to use md5-hashed UUIDs matching embed_single_memory_item
- **recreate_project_collections** — Missing `_intents_collection` (10th of 10 types)
- **Stale `__all__` exports** — Removed 3 undefined names from profile_loader.py
- **`setup-claude-code --force`** — Now actually clears hooks and statusLine before reinstall
- **README version** — Badge, docker commands, What's New, and footer now use version-agnostic regex in release script
- **requests dep** — Bumped floor to >=2.33.0 (CVE-2026-25645)

### Security
- 6 dependency CVEs audited: requests updated, werkzeug+pillow already pinned, pyasn1/pygments/pyjwt transitive
- Threshold values removed from sentinel-gate docstring to reduce AI information leakage

## [1.6.23] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Release auto-issue gate** — `--prepare` now checks for unresolved high-severity auto-captured issues before allowing publish. Prevents releasing with known runtime errors in the DB. Fails gracefully if CLI unavailable

### Fixed
- **`setup-claude-code --force` was a no-op for hooks/statusLine** — Plugin files were re-synced but hooks and statusLine were guarded by existence checks that silently skipped updates. `--force` now clears both before repopulating from current definitions. Fixes #66, reported by @Facarus

## [1.6.22] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Profile management CLI** — `profile-sync`, `profile-prune`, `profile-status` commands for epistemic profile lifecycle. Git notes as canonical portable format, SQLite as working database. Rule-based and manual pruning with `--dry-run` support
- **ProfileImporter** — Git-notes-to-SQLite import path. Rebuilds working database from portable git notes (findings, unknowns, dead-ends, mistakes, goals). INSERT OR IGNORE deduplication
- **Sentinel remote command classification** — SSH/rsync/scp commands now classified as noetic/praxic instead of blanket allow/deny. Inner commands extracted and classified using same SAFE_BASH_PREFIXES logic. Direction-aware for rsync/scp (upload=praxic, download=noetic). Includes Docker inspection, heredoc handling, chain/pipe parsing
- **Release script two-phase flow** — `--prepare` (merge, build, test gate) and `--publish` (push to all channels) split for safer releases

### Fixed
- **CHECK composite showed wrong percentage** — CHECK phase was calculating composite from execution vectors (state, change, completion, impact) instead of readiness vectors (know, context, clarity, coherence, signal, density). CHECK gates readiness-to-act, not acting progress
- **Statusline CHECK phase display** — Now shows percentage composite instead of just arrow/ellipsis
- **Profile resource leaks** — 3 `SessionDatabase` instances opened without try/finally in profile commands. db.close() was skipped on exceptions
- **Bootstrap NoneType comparison** — `workflow_suggestions.py` `duration_minutes` could be `None` when session `start_time` is NULL, causing `max(0.0, None)` TypeError. Also guarded `structure_health` conformance/confidence against None
- **Breadcrumbs showed resolved issues** — `get_auto_captured_issues` query returned issues regardless of status. Resolved/wontfix issues appeared as active high-severity problems in bootstrap output. Added status filter
- **CLAUDE.md template gaps** — Added TRANSACTION CONTEXT FIELDS section and profile commands to CORE COMMANDS
- **Docstring accuracy** — Fixed phantom command references in ProfileImporter module docstring, wrong return type in `_apply_prune_rule`
- **project-search project name resolution** — Resolve project names before Qdrant lookup. Contributed by @kars85 (#65)
- **project-search docs default** — Include project docs in focused search and initialize docs ignore defaults. Contributed by @kars85 (#63)

## [1.6.11] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Brier score calibration** — Replaced MAE (improper scoring rule) with Brier score (strictly proper, Murphy 1973 decomposition). Reliability, resolution, and uncertainty components available via `calibration-report --brier` and auto-exported to `.breadcrumbs.yaml`
- **Statusline redesign** — New format: `[project] ⚡87% ↕70% │ 🎯1 ❓2 │ PRE 🔍65% │ K:70% C:75%`. Threshold indicator (↕%) shows Sentinel's required confidence color-coded by calibration quality. Phase state shows transaction boundary + work mode (🔍 investigating / ⚙ acting) with composite score. All elements color-coded
- **Calibration anti-gaming** — Specific vector gaps, suggested ranges, and calibration bias removed from AI-facing output. Replaced with directional-only feedback (overestimate/underestimate tendency lists). Full calibration data remains user-facing via calibration-report and statusline

### Fixed
- **Threshold direction inverted** — Dynamic thresholds previously LOWERED gates for good calibration (wrong). Now: miscalibration RAISES thresholds to compensate for unreliable self-assessment. Good calibration keeps thresholds at domain baselines
- **Sentinel static-only thresholds** — `sentinel-gate.py` now reads Brier-based dynamic thresholds instead of using hardcoded constants only
- **Project-embed retrieval on Windows** — Path resolution against project root (not forced under `docs/`), lazy Qdrant collection creation, Ollama retry with progressive prompt truncation, Python code_api skipped for non-Python repos, accurate success reporting. Contributed by @kars85 (#58)
- **Subagent detection** — Sentinel uses `active_work` instead of `active_session` for subagent detection

### Changed
- **Calibration thresholds in MCO config** — Domain baselines, safety ceilings, max inflation, min transactions, and lookback moved from hardcoded constants to `cascade_styles.yaml`. Each transaction profile (default, exploratory, rigorous, rapid, expert, novice) has profile-appropriate calibration settings
- **Statusline extension protocol** — Removed hardcoded CRM/workspace DB queries from core statusline. Uses `statusline_ext/*.json` protocol only
- **InstanceResolver migration** — 28 files migrated from scattered `session_resolver` imports to unified `InstanceResolver` API

## [1.6.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **`InstanceResolver` class** - Unified API for all project/session/transaction resolution. Single import for hooks, CLI, sentinel, and statusline. Canonical in `session_resolver.py`, hook-side mirror in `project_resolver.py`. All existing module-level functions remain as backward-compatible aliases
- **Headless/interactive mode split** - `is_headless()` auto-detects containerized environments (no terminal identity) or via `EMPIRICA_HEADLESS=true`. In interactive mode, `active_work.json` (generic) is never consulted — `instance_projects` + `active_work_{uuid}` handle everything. Prevents stale cross-terminal pollution. Statusline silently exits in headless mode
- **DB-based file cleanup** - `cleanup_stale_active_work_files()` removes orphaned `active_work_{uuid}`, non-tmux `instance_projects`, and `active_session` files for sessions that have ended in the DB. Skips files with open transactions (compaction safety). Runs at session-init startup

### Fixed
- **Instance suffix mismatch** - Fixed 13 reader sites across 12 files that used raw `instance_id` (e.g., `x11:78940210`) for transaction file lookups instead of sanitized `_get_instance_suffix()` (e.g., `x11_78940210`). Caused file-not-found on non-tmux environments (X11, TTY)
- **Session-init not firing on resume** - `SessionStart` with type `resume` (continued conversation in new terminal) now triggers `session-init.py`, not just `post-compact.py`. Session-init detects existing sessions and updates anchor files without creating duplicates
- **Statusline wrong project after switch** - `project-switch` now updates `active_session_{suffix}` file so statusline reads correct project DB
- **`setup-claude-code` matchers** - Fixed SessionStart hook matchers generated by setup command: `compact` → post-compact, `startup|resume` → session-init (was `compact|resume` / `startup`)
- **Compact handoff filenames** - Standardized to use sanitized suffix (consistent with transaction files)

### Changed
- **Instance isolation docs** - Simplified ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md to reflect InstanceResolver, headless mode, and cleanup

## [1.6.7] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Statusline extension protocol** - Replaced hardcoded CRM/workspace SQL queries with generic file-based extension system. External packages write JSON to `~/.empirica/statusline_ext/*.json`, core reads and displays. Keeps workspace-specific logic (engagements, EKG) in empirica-workspace

### Fixed
- **Instance isolation docs** - Corrected priority chain documentation across 5 files. Post-1.6.4 doc edits incorrectly described different priorities for tmux vs non-tmux. The code uses the same chain everywhere: `instance_projects` first (authoritative), `active_work` fallback. Removed non-existent "self-healing" claim from SESSION_RESOLVER_API.md

## [1.6.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Non-tmux multi-session isolation** - `instance_projects` is authoritative in all environments. `active_work_{claude_session_id}` is the per-session fallback. Fixes cross-session contamination when running 2+ Claude Code instances in same terminal
- **session-init ttyname regression** - Replaced dead `os.ttyname(stdin)` with `get_tty_key()` (PPID walking) in session-init hook. Hooks receive stdin as JSON pipe so ttyname always fails, preventing `claude_session_id` propagation to TTY session files. Regression from `f9d607ed` that reverted fix `07148f9b` (#39)
- **Statusline project resolution** - Unified project resolution priority: `instance_projects` first in all environments

### Changed
- **Instance isolation docs** - Documented stdin pipe constraint, priority chain, and full 4-iteration fix history for known issue 11.20

## [1.6.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Non-tmux instance IDs** - Instance IDs for X11 (`x11_N`) and macOS Terminal (`term_N`) now use underscores matching the file naming convention. Previously used colons (`x11:N`) causing filename mismatch — Sentinel couldn't find transaction files, failing open silently. See known issue 11.20
- **Statusline stdin redirect** - Removed `< /dev/null` from statusline command generated by `setup-claude-code`. Claude Code pipes session JSON to stdin; the redirect was eating it, preventing session context resolution (#56)

### Added
- **Subagent Epistemic Assessment spec** - Core architecture for persona decomposition, Brier scoring, and earned autonomy for subagents

### Changed
- **Instance isolation docs** - Updated architecture docs to reflect non-tmux support. CHANGELOG entries for 1.6.2-1.6.5 (were missing)

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Work type tagging** - `work_type` (code, infra, research, etc.) and `work_context` (greenfield, iteration, investigation, refactor) fields in PREFLIGHT. Scales evidence weights by source relevance
- **Goalless-work discipline nudges** - Sentinel nudges when praxic work happens without active goals
- **Epistemic transaction skill** - Full interactive planning skill for decomposing work into measured transactions

### Fixed
- **MCP audit findings** - 12 Tier 1 tools added, stale metadata cleaned up
- **3 CLI bug fixes** - Various command handler fixes from 1.6.4 release audit

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **unknown-list command** - Browse and filter project unknowns from CLI
- **project-create/init bridge** - `--path` and `--project-id` flags for unified project setup
- **Qdrant rebuild** - `rebuild_qdrant_from_db()` for full Qdrant restoration from SQLite
- **Context-shift awareness** - Sentinel classifies solicited vs unsolicited user prompts

### Fixed
- **Embedding dimension validation** - Runtime check for qwen3-embedding:8b (4096d vs 0.6b 1024d), increased timeout
- **Calibration CWD bias** - PostTestCollector now uses project resolver chain, not CWD

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **qwen3-embedding default** - Upgraded from nomic-embed-text (768d) to qwen3-embedding (1024d, MTEB 64.3)
- **code-embed command** - AST-based API extraction and embedding for semantic code search
- **Phase-weighted calibration** - Holistic calibration with insights loop and actionable feedback
- **Prose evidence collector** - Non-code grounded calibration for writing/documentation work
- **Project.yaml v2.0** - Universal project identity with enrichment fields
- **Bootstrap decisions** - Includes Qdrant-stored decisions in project-bootstrap

### Fixed
- **File permission hardening** - State files use 0o700 dirs, 0o600 files
- **Statusline trust** - Reads authoritative file sources without end_time filter
- **Phase-gated evidence** - Collectors respect noetic/praxic phase boundaries
- **Calibration Goodhart risk** - Removed calibration mechanics from system prompt
- **project-init corruption** - Removed resolver context writes that corrupted multi-project sessions

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Code quality evidence in grounded calibration** - 8th evidence source: ruff, radon, pyright metrics from session-changed files. Maps violations to epistemic vectors (ruff→clarity/coherence, radon→density/signal, pyright→know/do). Evidence coverage ~38%→~62%
- **docs-assess ignore patterns** - `[tool.empirica.docs-assess]` in pyproject.toml with `ignore_classes` and `ignore_paths` (fnmatch patterns). Fallback `.docsignore` file support. Prevents internal utility classes from polluting coverage metrics
- **API reference documentation** - 4 new API docs (config_profiles, data_infrastructure, context_budget, metrics) and 15+ class entries across existing docs. Coverage 71.8%→84.0%
- **Architecture docs** - Claude Code symbiosis layer documentation (MEMORY.md hot cache, task-goal bridge, session lifecycle hooks). Updated storage architecture with 5th tier
- **Elicitation hooks** (pending CC support) - Hooks for AskUserQuestion (true UQ measurement) and ElicitationResult (auto-log answers as findings/decisions)
- **Tool failure hook** (pending CC support) - Auto-log tool failures as dead-ends

### Fixed
- **Git notes in empty repos** - `postflight-submit` no longer hangs in repos without commits. Added HEAD existence check before git notes operations (#53)
- **Symbiosis hook code quality** - Fixed bare excepts, type annotations, operator type issues, and unicode chars in session-end-postflight, task-completed, and epistemic_summarizer hooks. Refactored format_epistemic_focus complexity (CC 27→13)
- **Grounded calibration coverage** - `UNGROUNDABLE_VECTORS` reduced from {engagement, coherence, density} to {engagement}. Coherence and density now grounded via code quality metrics

### Security
- **flask** ≥3.1.3 (CVE-2026-27205)
- **werkzeug** ≥3.1.6 (CVE-2026-27199)
- **pillow** ≥12.1.1 (CVE-2026-25990)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Portable docs-assess** - `docs-assess` now works on any Python project via `ProjectConfig` auto-detection from `pyproject.toml`. Replaces 12+ hardcoded Empirica paths with config-driven references
- **Click CLI detection** - `docs-assess` discovers Click commands alongside existing argparse support. Tested on empirica (argparse, 197 commands) and empirica-outreach (Click, 6 commands)

### Fixed
- **Handler error returns** - `handle_docs_assess` and `handle_docs_explain` returned `None` on error (from `handle_cli_error()`) instead of exit code `1`, causing errors to be silently swallowed as success
- **Inconsistent arg access** - Unified both handlers to use `getattr()` pattern for `project_root` argument

## [1.5.9] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Sentinel File-Based Control** - Enable/disable Sentinel via `~/.empirica/sentinel_enabled` file flag, taking priority over `EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_LOOPING` env var. Dynamically settable without session restart
- **Transaction Planning Skill** - `/epistemic-transaction` skill gains interactive `plan-transactions` mode (Steps P1-P5): interview task, explore codebase, decompose into goals, generate YAML transaction plan with estimated vectors, execute

### Fixed
- **Sentinel Bypass** - System prompt contained bare `export EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_LOOPING=false` commands in code blocks. Claudes executed these, disabling Sentinel globally. Replaced with tables and "DO NOT execute" warnings across all templates and system prompts
- **SessionStart Matchers** - `setup-claude-code` generated invalid matchers (`new|fresh` and bare `compact`). Fixed to valid Claude Code values (`startup` and `compact|resume`). Updated all template files
- **Phantom Project ID** - `_get_project_id_from_local_db()` now reads `project.yaml` as authoritative source before falling back to `sessions.db`, preventing self-propagating phantom project IDs
- **Ghost Session Propagation** - Post-compact now detects and recovers from ghost sessions that don't exist in the database (documented as KNOWN_ISSUES 11.19)

### Removed
- **MirrorDriftMonitor** - Removed `empirica/core/drift/` module, `check-drift` CLI command, `check_drift` MCP tool, and all documentation references (-562 lines). Drift detection is handled by the grounded calibration pipeline (postflight → post-test → bayesian updates)

### Changed
- **README** - Removed empirica-crm from ecosystem projects, updated What's New to v1.5.9

## [1.5.8] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Semantic Layer Check** - `setup-claude-code` now detects Ollama (+ nomic-embed-text) and Qdrant availability, shows clear setup instructions if missing. Non-blocking — Empirica works without them but loses pattern injection, cross-session memory, and project-search
- **Workspace Context Plugin Hook** - Project-type-aware bootstrap via workspace context plugin hook
- **AST Dependency Graph** - Bootstrap uses AST dependency graph instead of file tree for smarter project context

### Fixed
- **Workspace DB Schema** (#51) - `workspace-init` and `project-list` failed on fresh installs because `global_projects` table DDL was missing. Added `ensure_workspace_schema()` with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all workspace tables
- **CLAUDE.md Overwrite** (#50) - `setup-claude-code` now writes Empirica prompt to separate file (`~/.claude/empirica-system-prompt.md`) with `@include` reference instead of overwriting user's CLAUDE.md. Preserves personal instructions, idempotent on re-run
- **Missing global_sessions Table** - Session registration silently skipped on fresh installs, breaking project-switch session continuity. Added schema creation in `ensure_workspace_schema()`
- **Missing entity_artifacts Table** - Entire entity cross-linking feature was non-functional; every artifact-log with `--entity-type` silently failed. Added schema creation
- **SessionStart Matcher** - Documented and fixed matcher bug for `new|fresh` vs `startup` trigger values (11.18)

### Changed
- **Taxonomy** - Added trajectory concept, defined transaction as noetic-praxic loop in documentation

## [1.5.7] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Qdrant Lazy Collections** - Collections created on first use instead of eagerly at init; `qdrant-status` and `qdrant-cleanup` commands for inventory and empty collection removal (#49)

### Fixed
- **Test Isolation** - `EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB` elevated to priority 0 in both `get_session_db_path()` and `resolve_session_db_path()`, preventing pytest subprocess tests from polluting the live database
- **Local Projects Table** - `project-switch` auto-populates `local_projects` table when switching to a project not yet registered locally (#48)

### Changed
- **Ref-Docs Coverage** - Updated CLI_ALIASES, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES, and MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS docs to cover qdrant commands and `EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB` priority 0 override

## [1.5.6] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Entity Scoping** - `--entity-type`, `--entity-id`, `--via` flags on all artifact commands (findings, unknowns, dead-ends, assumptions, decisions, mistakes, sources) for organization/contact/engagement scoping

### Fixed
- **Auto-Derive session_id** - `postflight-submit` and `preflight-submit` now auto-derive session_id from active transaction, matching other transaction commands
- **Postflight Project Resolution** - Uses canonical project resolution instead of CWD fallback that failed for non-CWD projects
- **Entity artifact_source** - Uses `trajectory_path` instead of `sessions.db` path for correct entity artifact sourcing
- **Sentinel INVESTIGATE Gaming** - Blocks gaming via new transaction creation to bypass investigate decisions

### Changed
- **Onboarding Rewrite** - Complete rewrite of `empirica onboard` with current capabilities: transactions, goals, noetic artifacts, dual-track calibration, Sentinel gate, JSON stdin mode
- **Documentation Overhaul** - Updated quickstart, CLI reference, troubleshooting, and end-user docs to current syntax; fixed broken links across 11+ files

## [1.5.5] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Schema Migration Ordering** (#44) - `CREATE INDEX` on `transaction_id` columns now runs after migrations that add the column, with `column_exists()` guards. Fixes crash on existing databases.
- **Qdrant File-Based Fallback Removed** (#45) - `_get_qdrant_client()` returns `None` when no server available instead of creating incompatible file-based storage. Added None guards to all 36 call sites across 10 modules.
- **project-embed Path Resolution** (#46) - Resolves `sessions.db` from `workspace.db` trajectory_path instead of CWD. Fixes 0-artifact embeddings for non-CWD projects.
- **transaction-adopt Same-Instance** (#44) - Skips file rename when `from_instance == to_instance` to prevent data loss.
- **Instance Isolation: Closed Transactions as Anchors** - Closed transactions persist until next PREFLIGHT, enabling post-compact project resolution after POSTFLIGHT closes the loop.
- **Lessons Storage Fallback** - `lessons/storage.py` now checks for running Qdrant server instead of falling back to file-based storage.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Autonomy Calibration Loop** - Sentinel tracks `tool_call_count` per transaction, PREFLIGHT calculates `avg_turns` from past POSTFLIGHTs, nudges at adaptive 1x/1.5x/2x thresholds (informational, not forced)
- **Subagent Governance** - Delegated work counting in SubagentStop (transcript tool_use parsing), pre-spawn budget check in SubagentStart (advisory, fail-open), `maxTurns: 25` default ceiling on all 9 agent types
- **Subagent Transaction Exemption** - Subagents detected via `active_work` file absence bypass Sentinel gates (parent CHECK authorizes spawn)
- **Auto-PREFLIGHT on `project-switch`** - Conservative baseline vectors submitted automatically after project bootstrap
- **Lifecycle Cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of stale `active_work`, `compact_handoff`, and `instance_projects` files at session boundaries
- **Release Pipeline: empirica-mcp** - `release.py` now builds and publishes `empirica-mcp` to PyPI alongside the main package

### Changed
- **install.sh Consolidation** - Remote installer is now a thin wrapper that delegates to `empirica setup-claude-code --force`
- **Release Pipeline** - Added `chocolateyinstall.ps1` and `CANONICAL_CORE.md` version header to automated version sync

### Fixed
- **Stale Transaction Detection** - Uses status-only check (`status != "open"`) instead of time-based eviction that broke overnight sessions
- **Instance Resolution Priority** - `instance_projects` checked first, `active_work` used as fallback only for non-TMUX environments
- **Project Switch via Bash** - Resolves `instance_id` from TTY session file when switching projects
- **Subagent Session Close** - `db.end_session()` now runs unconditionally (fixes #43)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **`transaction-adopt` Command** - Recover orphaned transactions when session state is lost after crash or compaction
- **`assumption-log` Command** - Log unverified beliefs with confidence and domain scoping (CLI + MCP)
- **`decision-log` Command** - Record choice points with rationale and reversibility (CLI + MCP)
- **Automated Release Script** - `release.py` now covers all version locations: `__init__.py`, plugin.json, install.sh, CLAUDE.md templates, README badge, and more

### Changed
- **Statusline Delta Display** - Replaced per-vector delta figures with single summary symbols (green check, red warning, white delta) to prevent single-line overflow
- **Unified Versioning** - CLAUDE.md system prompt now uses the same version number as the package (no separate prompt versioning)

### Fixed
- **Session Resolver Validation** - Validates session_id against DB to prevent stale post-compact propagation
- **MCP `--transaction-id` Flag** - Removed broken flag that was never wired up; MCP tools now use active transaction resolution
- **Test Isolation** - Tests no longer interfere with live transactions
- **Project Switch** - Handles both `trajectory_path` formats (string and dict)

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Phase-Aware Calibration** - Separate noetic/praxic calibration tracks with earned autonomy thresholds
- **Know Grounding** - Artifact counts now ground the `know` vector in post-test verification
- **Artifact Lifecycle** - Automatic resolution of stale unknowns and assumptions between transactions
- **Per-Instance Sentinel Toggle** - Each tmux pane can independently enable/disable Sentinel
- **Short ID Goal Matching** - Goals can be referenced by prefix instead of full UUID
- **Stdin Auto-Detect** - `preflight-submit` and `postflight-submit` auto-detect `-` for stdin
- **Sentinel INVESTIGATE Gaming Prevention** - Blocks investigation loops when a new transaction hasn't been opened
- **macOS Qdrant Launchd** - Setup script with 65536 file descriptor limits (#27)

### Fixed
- **macOS Instance Isolation** - TTY resolution bug and hook/resolver asymmetry (#39)
- **Non-Git Projects** - Git operations skip silently instead of erroring (#30)
- **Qdrant Hash Fallback** - Vector dimensions now match configured provider (#34)
- **Project Switch Without TMUX_PANE** - Resolves instance_id from claude_session_id (#36)
- **Session-Authoritative Project ID** - Uses sessions.db as authoritative source
- **Sentinel CLI Whitelist** - Added missing command aliases

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Instance Isolation Docs** - Reorganized into use-case-specific guides:
  - `CLAUDE_CODE.md` - Hook input structure, automatic sessions
  - `MCP_AND_CLI.md` - TTY-based isolation for non-Claude-Code users
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - File taxonomy, resolution chains
  - Container guidance for automated workflows

### Fixed
- **Windows Compatibility** - Platform detection for file locking (PR #32)
- **Windows Unicode** - safe_print() wrapper for cp1252 console (PR #31)
- **Post-Compact Session Mismatch** - Use transaction's session_id for instance_projects
- **Instance Isolation Resilience** - Works when claude_session_id unavailable via Bash

### Closed
- Issue #28: Sentinel multi-window race condition (fixed by instance isolation)
- Issue #29: goals-create wrong DB after compact (fixed by unified resolver)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Transaction-Session Continuity** - `read_active_transaction_full()` returns complete transaction data:
  - Session ID from PREFLIGHT is preserved across compaction boundaries
  - POSTFLIGHT auto-resolves session_id from transaction file, preventing stale summary errors

- **Shared Project Resolver** - Canonical `lib/project_resolver.py` for hooks:
  - All hooks now use single source of truth for project resolution
  - Priority chain: `active_work_{claude_session_id}` → `instance_projects/{instance_id}` → NO CWD fallback
  - Eliminates ~120 lines of duplicate resolution logic across sentinel, pre-compact, post-compact hooks

- **Context Budget Manager Events** - Bus integration for memory pressure:
  - `MEMORY_PRESSURE`, `CONTEXT_EVICTED`, `CONTEXT_INJECTED`, `PAGE_FAULT` events
  - Published to EpistemicBus for observer notification

### Changed
- **Sentinel Messages** - Opaque confidence feedback:
  - Blocking messages no longer reveal threshold values or current vectors
  - Prevents AI from gaming the gate by targeting specific numbers

- **Safe Pipe Targets** - Extended read-only whitelist:
  - Added `jq` to SAFE_PIPE_TARGETS for JSON processing during investigation

### Fixed

  - Eliminates mismatch when PREFLIGHT stored hash but sentinel computed different hash
  - Fixes "Project context changed" false positive when Claude navigates directories

- **MCP Server Project Resolution** - Session-aware CLI routing:
  - `route_to_cli()` now resolves project path from `session_id` before falling back to CWD
  - Fixes "Project not found" errors when MCP runs from different directory than Claude
  - Noetic artifact logging (finding-log, unknown-log) now finds correct project DB

- **Unified Context Resolver** - Centralized session/transaction/project resolution:
  - Added `get_active_context()` and `update_active_context()` to session_resolver.py
  - Single source of truth for claude_session_id, empirica_session_id, transaction_id, project_path
  - PREFLIGHT now uses unified resolver to update context atomically
  - Sentinel prioritizes transaction file's session_id (survives compaction boundaries)
  - Fixes "loop closed" false positive when transactions span sessions

### Added (continued)
- **Epistemic Transactions** - First-class measurement windows with `transaction_id`:
  - PREFLIGHT→POSTFLIGHT cycles are now discrete measurement transactions
  - Multiple goals can exist within one transaction; one goal can span multiple transactions
  - Transaction boundaries defined by coherence of changes, not by goal boundaries
  - Adds `transaction_id` column to epistemic assessments for precise delta tracking

  - `/empirica on|off|status` command for Claude Code plugin
  - Controls sentinel enforcement and epistemic tracking

- **Eidetic Rehydration** - Full Qdrant restore via `project-embed`:
  - Rebuilds eidetic memory from cold storage to search layer

- **Auto-Init Sessions** - `--auto-init` flag on `session-create`:
  - Automatically initializes project if not yet tracked (closes #25)

- **Collaborator Config Sync** - `empirica-collab-sync.sh` script:
  - Syncs breadcrumbs, calibration, and plugin config between collaborators

### Changed
- **Schema Consolidation** - `session_*` tables consolidated into `project_*` as canonical source
- **Sentinel Path Resolution** - Refactored to use canonical `path_resolver` instead of custom logic

  - Dual-track calibration (self-referential + grounded verification)
  - Post-test evidence collection triggers automatically on POSTFLIGHT
  - Trajectory tracking across transactions
- **Dynamic Calibration** - Sentinel now uses per-session bias corrections from `.breadcrumbs.yaml`
- **Vocabulary Taxonomy** - Formalized Empirica concept reference and taxonomy in SKILL.md v2.0.0

### Fixed

- **Session Instance Isolation** - Respects `instance_id` in auto-close for multi-tmux-pane support
- **Finding Deduplication** - Deduplicates on insert; archives stale plans on session init
- **PREFLIGHT Pattern Retrieval** - Falls back to reasoning when Qdrant unavailable
- **Migration Safety** - Skips migration 021 if engagements table missing; adds client_projects to valid tables

### Security
- **Tiered Sentinel Permissions** - Replaced blanket `empirica` CLI whitelist with role-based permission tiers (read-only, write, admin)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **MCP Multi-Project Support** - MCP server now supports explicit workspace configuration:
  - `--workspace` argument sets project root for multi-project environments
  - Auto-detects from git root if `.empirica/` exists
  - Fallback to common development paths (`~/empirical-ai/empirica`, `~/empirica`)
  - Fixes sessions being created in global `~/.empirica/` instead of project `.empirica/`

### Fixed
- **Sentinel Gate: Empirica CLI** - Allow `empirica` CLI commands with heredocs (stdin JSON input)
- **Sentinel Gate: Stderr Redirects** - Allow safe stderr redirects (`2>/dev/null`, `2>&1`) while still blocking file writes

### Changed
- **Docs Clarification** - Claude Code users don't need MCP server; hooks provide full functionality
- **MCP Workspace Configuration** - Added section to CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md for multi-project setup

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Sentinel Safe Pipe Chains** - Noetic firewall now allows piped commands to safe read-only targets (head, tail, wc, grep, sort, etc.) while blocking dangerous pipes
- **Anti-Gaming Mitigations** - Sentinel detects rushed PREFLIGHT→CHECK transitions (<30s) without investigation evidence
- **Complete Plugin Installer** - One-line curl install for Claude Code integration with all components (hooks, statusline, CLAUDE.md, MCP server)

### Changed
- **Calibration Update** - 2496 observations, updated bias corrections (completion: +0.75, know: +0.17, uncertainty: -0.11)
- **Qdrant Optional** - Memory/semantic search features gracefully handle missing Qdrant; core epistemic transaction workflow uses SQLite only
- **MCP Tool Mappings** - Added missing tools (session_snapshot, goals_ready, goals_claim, investigate, vision_analyze, edit_with_confidence)

  ```
  - Shows unknowns linked to specific goals
  - Helps identify what's preventing goal completion

- **Statusline Project-Wide Unknowns** - Enhanced statusline shows:
  - Project-wide unknowns with goal-linked blockers
  - Instance-specific active_session files for tmux isolation
  - Upward search for `.empirica/` like git does for `.git/`

- **docs-assess Enhancements** - New flags for documentation assessment:
  - `--check-docstrings` - Check Python docstring coverage
  - `--turtle` - Spawn parallel assessment agents

- **Search-First Bootstrap Architecture** - Improved project-bootstrap:
  - Adaptive limits based on content availability
  - Eidetic and episodic memory in unified search
  - 'focused' mode (eidetic + episodic) is now the default

### Changed
- **Sentinel CHECK Age Expiry** - Now opt-in (not default). High-stakes environments can enable via flags
- **goals-list Refactoring** - Works without `--session-id`:
  - No filters: shows all active goals
  - `--session-id`: filter by session

- **Sentinel Timestamp Parsing** - Fixed bug causing CHECK gate failures
- **Statusline tmux Cross-Pane Bleeding** - Instance-specific active_session files prevent cross-pane contamination
- **Storage Dimension Hardcoding** - Now uses core embeddings provider instead of hardcoded 384-dim
- **assess-directory** - Excludes `__init__.py` files by default
- **Test Compatibility** - Updated tests for flat vector format

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Epistemic Investigation** - Spawn parallel investigation agents with different personas to explore codebase corners:
  ```bash
  empirica agent-spawn --session-id <ID> --task "..." --turtle
  ```
  Features:
  - Automatic persona selection with `--turtle` flag
  - Parallel branch execution with POSTFLIGHT aggregation
  - Findings/unknowns automatically logged to parent session

- **Onboarding Projects** - Two complete mini-projects for learning Empirica workflows:
  - `api-explorer/` - Discovery exercise with intentionally incomplete API docs
  - `refactor-decision/` - Decision-making exercise with multiple valid approaches
  - Each includes WALKTHROUGH.md and SOLUTION.md for guided learning

### Changed
- **Documentation Accuracy Audit** - Comprehensive updates via multi-agent investigation:
  - DATABASE_SCHEMA_UNIFIED.md: Updated from 19 to 31 tables (added Session Breadcrumbs, Lessons System, Infrastructure sections)
  - MCP_SERVER_REFERENCE.md: Updated tool count from 40 to 57 tools
  - Added cross-references between Sentinel, epistemic transactions, and Noetic/Praxic docs

  ```bash
  empirica project-switch <project-name-or-id>
  ```
  Features:
  - Resolves projects by name (case-insensitive) or UUID
  - Shows "you are here" context banner with project details
  - Automatically runs project-bootstrap for context loading
  - Displays project status (sessions, flow state, health)
  - Shows next steps (session-create, goals-ready)
  - JSON output support for programmatic use

### Fixed

1. **check-submit Vector Format Handling** - Added robust vector normalization to handle multiple input formats:
   - Flat dictionary: `{engagement: 0.85, know: 0.75, ...}`
   - Structured dictionary: `{foundation: {know, do, context}, comprehension: {...}, execution: {...}}`
   - Wrapped dictionary: `{vectors: {...}}`
   - JSON string inputs (AI-first mode)
   
   Fixes "Vectors must be a dictionary" errors when using structured transaction format.
   
2. **agent-spawn Persona Schema Validation** - Fixed validation errors for persona records:
   - PersonaManager.load_persona() now normalizes public_key to valid Ed25519 format (64 hex chars)
   - Auto-fills missing focus_domains with `['general']` for backward compatibility
   - Default persona in epistemic_agent.py now includes focus_domains
   
   Fixes "public_key 'scout_key_placeholder' invalid" and "focus_domains is required property" errors.
   
3. **Findings/Unknowns/Dead-ends Duplication** - Fixed duplicate breadcrumbs in project-bootstrap output:
   - Changed `UNION ALL` to `UNION` in 8 queries across breadcrumbs.py (get_project_findings, get_project_unknowns, get_project_dead_ends)
   - When scope='both', findings were written to both session_findings and project_findings tables
   - UNION automatically deduplicates while preserving dual-scope architecture

### Changed
- docs/PROJECT_SWITCHING_FOR_AIS.md: Updated status from "CRITICAL" to "IMPLEMENTED" with completed checklist items

### Tests
- Added 4 new tests for project-switch command (all passing)
- Total: 281 tests passing

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Epistemic Release Agent** (`empirica release-ready`) - Pre-release verification command with epistemic principles:
  - Version sync check across pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CLAUDE.md prompt version
  - Architecture turtle assessment on core/, cli/, data/ directories
  - PyPI package verification for empirica and empirica-mcp
  - Privacy/security scan for secrets, credentials, and dev files
  - Documentation completeness check (README, CHANGELOG, docs/)
  - Git status verification (branch, uncommitted changes, unpushed commits)
  - Respects .gitignore patterns - only flags items NOT covered by gitignore
  - Moon phase indicators (🌕🌔🌓🌒🌑) for visual status
  - JSON output for CI/automation (`--output json`)
  - Quick mode (`--quick`) to skip architecture assessment

### Fixed
- **Issue Resolution Bug** - `issue-resolve` command was filtering by session_id, preventing resolution of issues from different sessions. Removed session_id constraint from WHERE clause.
- **Goal Completion Bug** - `goals-complete` command returned success but never updated goal status in database. Added missing UPDATE statement to set status='completed'.
- **Ollama Auto-Detection** - Embeddings now auto-detect Ollama availability and use semantic embeddings when available, falling back to local hash when not.
- **Sentinel Auto-Enable** - Sentinel now auto-enables with default epistemic evaluator on module load, appearing in transaction responses.

### Changed
- Added `.beads/` and `*.pem` to .gitignore for security
- Reorganized .gitignore with "Security-sensitive files" section

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Flow State Display Slice Error** - Fixed TypeError in project-bootstrap command where flow_data was incorrectly treated as a list when it's actually a dictionary. Changed to properly access flow_metrics['flow_scores']. This was causing "slice(None, 5, None)" error messages in bootstrap output.
- **Missing Flow Metrics Components** - Added 'components' and 'recommendations' fields to flow metrics data structure. Components now show weighted breakdown of flow score factors (engagement, capability, clarity, etc.), and recommendations are generated from identify_flow_blockers().

### Added
- **Auto-Capture Logging Hooks** - Implemented true automatic error capture via Python's logging system:
  - Added `AutoCaptureLoggingHandler` class that hooks into logging.ERROR and logging.CRITICAL
  - Added `install_auto_capture_hooks()` function that installs both logging.Handler and sys.excepthook
  - Integrated into session creation - errors are now captured automatically during CLI execution
  - Captures context (logger name, module, function, line number) for better debugging
  - Non-blocking design - capture errors don't break the application
- Auto-capture now truly "auto" - no explicit calls needed, errors logged anywhere in codebase are captured

### Verified
- JSON output working correctly for project-bootstrap and session-snapshot commands
- Cross-project isolation confirmed with 15 projects
- Dynamic context loading via --depth parameter (minimal/moderate/full/auto)
- Session-optional commands working as documented
- Learning delta calculation accurate in session snapshots

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Schema/API Mismatch in Epistemic Artifacts** - BreadcrumbRepository methods (log_finding, log_unknown, log_dead_end) expected schema columns that were missing from database definitions:
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_findings table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_findings table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_dead_ends table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_dead_ends table
- Impact: Users following system prompt documentation would get immediate SQLite errors when trying to use epistemic artifact tracking
- Testing: Verified with fresh project initialization - all epistemic tracking APIs now work correctly
- This fix enables proper meta-tracking of complex multi-channel projects (e.g., outreach campaigns)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: CHECK GATE confidence threshold bug** - The CHECK command was ignoring explicit confidence values provided by AI agents and instead calculating confidence from uncertainty vectors (1.0 - uncertainty). This prevented the proper enforcement of the ≥0.70 confidence threshold for the epistemic transaction gate. Fixed by:
  - Extracting `explicit_confidence` from CHECK input config
  - Using explicit confidence in decision logic when provided
  - Making proceed/investigate decision based on confidence ≥ 0.70 threshold as per system design
  - Keeping drift and unknowns as secondary evidence validation
- **Impact**: All users now have a properly functioning CHECK GATE that respects stated confidence while validating against evidence

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Version 1.1.0 Release** - Fixed version mismatch issue where build artifacts contained old version

- **Version consistency** - Updated all documentation and configuration files to reflect 1.1.0

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Epistemic Vector-Based Functional Self-Awareness Framework** - Updated CLI tagline to better reflect core focus
- **Documentation organization** - Moved development docs to archive, organized guides and reference docs
- **Version alignment** - Updated version across all documentation files

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **workspace-overview command** - Epistemic project management dashboard
  - Shows epistemic health of all projects in workspace
  - Health scoring algorithm: `(know * 0.6) + ((1 - uncertainty) * 0.4) - (dead_end_ratio * 0.2)`
  - Color-coded health tiers: 🟢 high (≥0.7), 🟡 medium (0.5-0.7), 🔴 low (<0.5)
  - Sorting options: activity, knowledge, uncertainty, name
  - Filtering by project status: active, inactive, complete
  - JSON and dashboard output formats
  
- **workspace-map command** - Git repository discovery
  - Scans parent directory for git repositories
  - Shows which repos are tracked in Empirica
  - Displays epistemic health metrics for tracked projects
  - Suggests commands to track untracked repositories
  - Enables workspace-wide epistemic visibility

### Database
- `get_workspace_overview()` - Aggregates epistemic state across all projects
- `_get_workspace_stats()` - Calculates workspace-level statistics
- Health metrics include: know, uncertainty, findings, unknowns, dead ends

### Dogfooding
- Successfully used Empirica's full epistemic transaction workflow to build these features
- PREFLIGHT → CHECK → POSTFLIGHT assessments captured
- Learning deltas: know +0.13, completion +0.75, uncertainty -0.20
- BEADS integration tested with 3 issues tracked and closed

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **Improved goals-list UX** - Shows helpful preview of 5 most recent goals when no session ID provided
- Preview includes goal ID, objective, session ID, completion percentage, and progress
- Better guidance for creating sessions and querying goals properly

### Changed
- **goals-list** command now provides more helpful error messages and previews instead of failing silently
- Goal/subtask query workflow improved with contextual hints

### Fixed
- Goal completion command now uses correct repository methods
- Project embed command properly handles goal/subtask metadata

### Refactored
- Moved `forgejo-plugin-empirica/` (125MB) to separate `empirica-dashboards` repo
- Moved `slides/` (72MB) to separate `empirica-web` repo  
- Moved `archive/` folder to `empirica-web` repo
- Reduced main package size by ~200MB for cleaner distribution

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **`empirica project-init` command** - Interactive onboarding for new repositories
- **Per-project SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml** - Each repo can have its own semantic documentation index
- **Project-level BEADS defaults** - Configure BEADS behavior per-project
- **CLI hints for BEADS** - Helpful tips after goal creation
- **Better error messages** - Install instructions when BEADS CLI not found
- **Configuration examples** - Added docs/examples/project.yaml.example

### Fixed
- **Database fragmentation (AI Amnesia)** - MCP server now uses repo-local database
- **refdoc-add UnboundLocalError** - Fixed variable usage before assignment
- **MCP server postflight regression** - Added missing resolve_session_id import
- **goals-ready schema bug** - Fixed vectors_json → individual columns
- **Project auto-detection** - Made --project-id optional with git remote URL auto-detection

### Changed
- **Project-session linking** - Added explicit --project-id flag to session-create
- **Project bootstrap** - Now auto-detects project from git remote
- **Documentation organization** - Moved session summaries to docs/development/

### Investigated
- **BEADS default behavior** - Kept opt-in (matches industry standards: Git LFS, npm, Python)
- Evidence: 5 major tools analyzed, high confidence decision (know=0.9, uncertainty=0.15)
