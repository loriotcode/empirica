"""
Evidence-to-Vector Mapper

Maps objective evidence items to estimated vector values.
Only produces estimates for vectors with sufficient evidence.
Uses weighted aggregation when multiple evidence items support the same vector.

Calibration scoring uses domain-aware category weights (Tier 1) from
confidence_weights.yaml. Per-vector weights (Tier 2) can be passed in
from project.yaml for per-project, per-phase dynamic weighting.

Ungroundable vectors (no objective signal): engagement.
Coherence and density are now grounded via code quality metrics (ruff, radon).
These keep self-referential calibration.

NOTE on proxy limitations: All evidence sources here are deterministic proxies.
Test pass rates approximate 'know' but miss conceptual understanding depth.
Git metrics approximate 'do' but miss quality of thought behind changes.
Artifact counts approximate 'signal' but can't judge relevance of what was logged.
The calibration gaps computed here are drift indicators — useful for detecting
systematic bias patterns over time, but not ground truth for any single transaction.

    This aligns with the statusline's confidence formula, which treats
