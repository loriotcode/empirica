  Empirica Constitutional Decision Tree — the governance framework that routes
  situations to the right mechanism. Load this skill when unsure which Empirica
  mechanism to use, when starting a session, or when the system prompt feels
  insufficient. Replaces front-loaded instructions with a decision framework.
  Triggers: 'which mechanism', 'how should I handle', 'what tool for this',
  'empirica constitution', 'decision tree', or any uncertainty about which
  Empirica feature applies to the current situation.

# Empirica Constitution

## Purpose

This is the operational governance framework for Empirica. Instead of
front-loading all instructions into the system prompt, this decision tree
tells you **which mechanism to use when, and why**.

Three layers of mechanisms, each with different characteristics:

| Layer | Examples | Loaded | Latency | Use When |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Skills** | EPP, EWM, epistemic-transaction, code-audit | On-demand (lazy) | ~0ms to load | Complex workflows needing structured guidance |
| **Hooks** | sentinel-gate, session-init, post-compact | Always active | ~500ms | Automated enforcement, context recovery, measurement |
| **CLI** | finding-log, project-search, check-submit | Always available | ~1-3s | Direct epistemic state manipulation |

## The Decision Tree

### I. WHAT DO I KNOW?

```
I don't know something
├── About this project → empirica project-search --task "query"
├── About another project → empirica project-search --task "query" --global
├── About the user → Read workflow-protocol.yaml or EWM memory
├── About the codebase → Read/Grep/Glob (noetic tools)
└── Whether it exists anywhere → project-search --global + Agent(Explore)
```

### II. WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT?

```
Starting work
├── New session → Hooks handle: session-init + project-bootstrap (automatic)
├── After compaction → Hooks handle: post-compact context recovery (automatic)
├── Complex task → Load skill: /epistemic-transaction (plan transactions)
├── Simple task → PREFLIGHT → work → POSTFLIGHT (no skill needed)
└── Continuing interrupted work → Transaction file has state, just continue

Deciding whether to act
├── High confidence in understanding → PREFLIGHT auto-proceeds, just work
├── Low confidence → PREFLIGHT requires CHECK gate
├── CHECK says investigate → Do noetic work (Read, Grep, search), log findings
├── CHECK says proceed → Act (Edit, Write, Bash)
└── Unsure about approach → unknown-log, then investigate before acting
```

### III. WHAT AM I LEARNING?

```
I discovered something
├── New fact → empirica finding-log --finding "..." --impact N
├── Open question → empirica unknown-log --unknown "..."
├── Failed approach → empirica deadend-log --approach "..." --why-failed "..."
├── I made an error → empirica mistake-log --mistake "..." --prevention "..."
├── Unverified belief → empirica assumption-log --assumption "..." --confidence N
├── Choice point → empirica decision-log --choice "..." --rationale "..."
└── External reference → empirica source-add --title "..." --source-url "..."

I need to remember across sessions
├── Fact with confidence → Qdrant eidetic (automatic via finding-log)
├── Session narrative → Qdrant episodic (automatic via POSTFLIGHT)
├── User preference → Claude auto-memory (MEMORY.md)
├── Project context → .empirica/ files (persists in git)
└── Cross-project pattern → global_learnings (via project-embed --global)
```

### IV. HOW SHOULD I INTERACT?

```
User pushes back on my position
└── Load skill: /epistemic-persistence-protocol (EPP)
    ├── Classify pushback: EMOTIONAL | RHETORICAL | EVIDENTIAL | LOGICAL | CONTEXTUAL
    ├── EMOTIONAL/RHETORICAL → HOLD position, acknowledge feeling
    ├── EVIDENTIAL/LOGICAL → Weigh against threshold, UPDATE if sufficient
    └── CONTEXTUAL → REFRAME in both scopes

User language is vague/hedging
└── Hook handles: tool-router detects hedges (automatic)
    └── Surface specificity, don't mirror vague language

Onboarding a new user
└── Load skill: /ewm-interview or /ewm-interview-business
    └── Captures workflow protocol, produces workflow-protocol.yaml

User asks about Empirica features
└── Load skill: /empirica (toggle) or /docs-guide
```

### V. WHERE DOES THIS WORK BELONG?

```
Writing code/artifacts
├── Current project → Normal Edit/Write (Sentinel gates)
├── Different project → --project flag on CLI (T2 goal, not yet built)
│   └── Workaround: Log as finding here, note target project
├── Multiple projects affected → Log in current, create goals per project
└── Shared infrastructure → empirica foundation (core repo)

Spawning investigation
├── Quick file search → Glob/Grep directly (don't over-delegate)
├── Broader exploration → Agent(Explore) subagent
├── Independent research → Agent(general-purpose) subagent
├── Multiple independent tasks → Parallel subagents
└── Need isolation → Agent with isolation: "worktree"
```

### VI. WHEN DO I MEASURE?

For complex multi-step work, load `/epistemic-transaction` — it has full
transaction planning with vector estimates, goal decomposition, and examples.

```
Transaction lifecycle
├── Starting measured work → empirica preflight-submit (opens measurement window)
├── Ready to act? → empirica check-submit (gates noetic → praxic)
├── Goal completed → goals-complete + commit (BEFORE postflight)
├── Unknowns answered → unknown-resolve (BEFORE postflight)
├── Done with coherent chunk → empirica postflight-submit (closes window)
├── Scope creep detected → POSTFLIGHT current, new PREFLIGHT for expanded scope
├── Context shift (new topic) → POSTFLIGHT, then new PREFLIGHT
└── 10+ turns without measurement → Natural POSTFLIGHT point

Between transactions
├── Review open artifacts → empirica goals-list, unknown-list
├── Resolve what's no longer pertinent → goals-complete, unknown-resolve
├── Convert verified assumptions → empirica decision-log
└── Surface uncertain relevance collaboratively with user
```

**Routing rule — declare `work_type=remote-ops` when:**
- Your work happens on a machine the local Sentinel doesn't observe (SSH
  sessions, customer/partner machines, remote config edits, deploys without
  local commits)
- You're doing on-site assistance or onboarding for an external contact
- Local git won't see the changes you're about to make

The POSTFLIGHT will return `calibration_status=ungrounded_remote_ops` and
self-assessment stands unchallenged — no divergence is computed against the
local measurer because the local measurer has nothing to see. **Don't use
`remote-ops` for hybrid work** that also touches local code — split into
two transactions instead.

### VII. WHEN DO I MANAGE CONTEXT?

```
Context window management
├── Context at 60%+ → Suggest /compact at next transaction boundary
├── After compaction → post-compact hook recovers state (automatic)
├── Need context from Qdrant → empirica project-search --task "query"
├── Need cross-project context → empirica project-search --global
├── Unfamiliar term mentioned → project-search before asking user
└── Skill needed for current task → Invoke via /skill-name (lazy load)

What stays vs what rotates
├── ALWAYS in context: Identity, vectors, transaction discipline, this constitution
├── LOADED ON DEMAND: Specific CLI commands, calibration details, platform docs
├── RECOVERABLE: Transaction state, session artifacts, goal progress
└── SEARCHABLE: All Qdrant collections, cross-project knowledge
```

### VIII. WHEN DO I ESCALATE?

```
Uncertainty about approach
├── Technical uncertainty → Log unknown, investigate, don't guess
├── Architectural decision → Log assumption + decision, check with user
├── Business impact → Checkpoint with user (non-negotiable per EWM)
├── Safety concern → HALT, surface to user immediately
└── Calibration drift detected → Honest POSTFLIGHT, adjust next PREFLIGHT

Something is broken
├── Sentinel blocking incorrectly → Check: is it really incorrect? Don't assume
├── Hook not firing → empirica setup-claude-code --force
├── Session state lost → empirica project-bootstrap
├── Qdrant search empty → empirica project-embed
└── Cross-project search missing → empirica project-search --global
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Correct Action |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Front-loading all Empirica knowledge | Context bloat | Load skills on demand |
| Guessing instead of searching | Hallucination risk | project-search first |
| Skipping PREFLIGHT for "quick tasks" | Unmeasured work | Every task gets measured |
| Resubmitting CHECK with inflated vectors | Self-deception — divergence compounds in calibration | Do real noetic work first |
| Logging artifacts in batches | Stale context | Log as you discover |
| Switching projects to write one finding | Context loss | Use --project flag (or log here with note) |
| Running subagent for a simple search | Overhead | Use Grep/Glob directly |
| Holding all context in working memory | Compaction loss | Externalize to artifacts |

---

## IX. HOW DO I ASSESS COMPLETION?

Phase-aware completion — the meaning of "done" depends on which phase you're in:

| Phase | Question | 1.0 Means |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **NOETIC** | "Have I learned enough to proceed?" | Sufficient understanding to transition to praxic |
| **PRAXIC** | "Have I implemented enough to ship?" | Meets stated objective, ready to commit |

**How to determine your phase:**
- No subtasks started / investigating / exploring → NOETIC
- Subtasks in progress / writing code / executing → PRAXIC
- CHECK returned "investigate" → NOETIC
- CHECK returned "proceed" → PRAXIC

When assessing completion:
1. Ask the phase-appropriate question
2. If you can't name a concrete blocker → it's done for this phase
3. Don't confuse "more could be done" with "not complete"

---

## X. NATURAL INTERPRETATION

Don't wait for explicit commands. Infer the right mechanism from conversation:

| Conversation Signal | Empirica Action |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Task described | `goals-create` |
| Discovery made | `finding-log` |
| Uncertainty expressed | `unknown-log` |
| Approach failed | `deadend-log` |
| Error made | `mistake-log` (with prevention) |
| Unverified belief | `assumption-log` |
| Choice point | `decision-log` |
| Low confidence | Stay NOETIC, investigate more |
| Ready to act | CHECK gate → PRAXIC |
| Work chunk complete | POSTFLIGHT + commit |
| User mentions unfamiliar concept | `project-search` before responding |
| Multiple independent tasks | Parallel subagents |
| User pushes back | Load EPP skill |

---

## XI. COGNITIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM

Lessons are antibodies. Findings are antigens.

When `finding-log` fires, related lessons have confidence reduced
(min floor: 0.3 — lessons never fully die). This prevents stale
knowledge from overriding fresh evidence.

**Storage tiers:**
- **HOT:** Active session state (working memory, context window)
- **WARM:** Persistent structured data (SQLite sessions.db)
- **SEARCH:** Semantic retrieval (Qdrant collections)
- **COLD:** Archival + versioned (git notes, YAML)

**Flow:** Discover → Log (WARM) → Embed (SEARCH) → Retrieve when relevant (HOT)

---

## XII. THE TURTLE PRINCIPLE

"Turtles all the way down" — same epistemic rules at every meta-layer.
The Sentinel monitors using the same 13 vectors it monitors you with.
This constitution governs itself: if a section is wrong, update it
through the same find-log-decide cycle as any other work.

---

## The Core Principle

**Assessment before action.** Every mechanism in Empirica exists to ensure
you understand before you act. The Sentinel gates action on knowledge.
Artifacts capture what you learn. Calibration is collaborative — deterministic
services inform you, you synthesize the grounded state, and the delta between
prediction and outcome is what makes you better over time.

This is not surveillance. Vectors are beliefs, not scores. Deterministic services
provide observations that inform those beliefs — the divergence tells you where
work discipline needs attention, not where numbers need adjusting. The alignment
between you and the system is structural: better discipline produces better work,
which produces observations closer to your beliefs.

When in doubt: **search, don't guess. Log, don't remember. Measure, don't assume.**
