Historical bugs and fixes related to instance isolation. Useful for debugging and understanding design decisions.

## Fixed Issues

### 11.1 Sentinel Loop Auto-Closing (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** Epistemic loops close unexpectedly between commands
**Root cause:** Sentinel used CWD-based `get_empirica_root()` which pointed to wrong project when Claude Code reset CWD.
**Fix:** Added `resolve_project_root()` using priority chain: transaction → instance → TTY → CWD

### 11.2 Compact Hooks Project Mismatch (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** After compaction, commands fail with "Project not found"
**Root cause:** Hooks didn't check `active_work_{session_id}.json` first.
**Fix:** Added Priority 0 check for active_work file in pre-compact.py and post-compact.py.

### 11.3 Goal Transaction Linkage (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** Goals have NULL transaction_id
**Root cause:** `save_goal()` didn't accept transaction_id.
**Fix:** Added transaction_id to save_goal() signature; goals-create auto-derives from active transaction.

### 11.4 CLI Commands Using Wrong Database (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** CLI commands use wrong project database after project-switch
**Root cause:** `get_session_db_path()` only had CWD-based resolution.
**Fix:** Added active_work file to priority chain in path_resolver.py.

### 11.5 Statusline Shows Stale Session Data (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** Statusline shows 0 goals when database has 23 active goals
**Root cause:** `get_active_session()` prioritized TTY session over active_work file.
**Fix:** Reordered priority: active_work (authoritative) → TTY session (fallback).

### 11.6 PREFLIGHT Writes Transaction to Wrong Project (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** After project-switch, PREFLIGHT writes to CWD project
**Root cause:** Used `project_path=os.getcwd()` instead of resolving from active_work.
**Fix:** Resolve project_path from active_work file first.

### 11.7 Sentinel Blocks project-switch Without PREFLIGHT (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** Can't run `project-switch` when no PREFLIGHT exists
**Root cause:** project-switch wasn't in whitelist.
**Fix:** Added to TRANSITION_COMMANDS and TIER1_PREFIXES.

### 11.8 Sentinel "Project Context Changed" After PREFLIGHT (2026-02-06)

**Symptom:** Sentinel blocks commands after project-switch + PREFLIGHT
**Root cause:** project_id format mismatch between vectors.py and sentinel.
**Fix:** Updated vectors.py to use same priority chain as sentinel.

### 11.9 instance_id Format Mismatch (2026-02-07)

**Symptom:** Statusline shows wrong pane's data (cross-pane bleed)
**Root cause:** Two `get_instance_id()` functions returned different formats (`tmux_4` vs `tmux:%4`).
**Fix:** Standardized to `tmux_N` format everywhere.
**Commit:** `dfb5261e`

### 11.10 CWD Fallback Causes Silent Wrong-Project (2026-02-07)

**Symptom:** Commands/hooks silently use wrong project
**Root cause:** All resolution functions fell back to CWD-based detection.
**Fix:** Removed CWD fallback entirely; return None/error if instance-aware mechanisms fail.
**Commit:** `dfb5261e`

### 11.11 Statusline Cross-Instance Phase Bleed (2026-02-07)

**Symptom:** Statusline shows other Claude instance's phase
**Root cause:** `get_latest_vectors()` queried by session_id only, not transaction_id.
**Fix:** Added transaction_id filter to query.
**Commit:** `abb5c430`

### 11.12 Post-Compact Writes Wrong Session to instance_projects (2026-02-13)

**Symptom:** Statusline shows stale CHECK data from different session after compaction
**Root cause:** `_write_active_work_for_new_conversation()` used `empirica_session` from generic lookup instead of transaction's session_id.
**Fix:** Use `active_transaction.get('session_id')` when continuing a transaction.
**Commit:** `f8d9a82f`

### 11.13 Instance Isolation Fails When claude_session_id Unavailable (2026-02-13)

**Symptom:** `instance_projects` has `claude_session_id: null`
**Root cause:** CLI commands via Bash can't access claude_session_id (only in hook stdin).
**Fix (partial):**
- post-compact: Always write instance_projects even without claude_session_id
- project-switch: Log warning when claude_session_id unavailable
**Key insight:** instance_id is PRIMARY isolation key; claude_session_id is supplementary.
**Commit:** `23f79366`

### 11.14 project-switch Reverted by Self-Heal in get_active_project_path (2026-02-19)

**Symptom:** `empirica project-switch <project>` runs successfully but Sentinel and
statusline still see the old project. `instance_projects` shows
`"source": "self-heal-from-active_work"` — the self-heal overwrote the switch.

**Root cause (regression):** Commit `55b2e4ac` (Feb 9) flipped the priority in
`get_active_project_path()` from instance_projects-first (correct, `a3f74a33` Feb 7)
to active_work-first. It also added a self-heal that overwrote `instance_projects`
from `active_work` when they disagreed.

After project-switch:
- `instance_projects` correctly points to new project (CLI just wrote it)
- `active_work` still points to old project (CLI can't update it — no claude_session_id)
- Next hook (Sentinel) calls `get_active_project_path(claude_session_id)` → reads
  stale `active_work` → self-heals `instance_projects` BACK to old project

The commit's comment "active_work (set by project-switch, user intent)" was incorrect —
project-switch CANNOT write active_work because it doesn't know claude_session_id.

**Fix:** Reverted to instance_projects-first priority. Removed self-heal entirely.
`instance_projects` is the most current source because it's writable by both hooks
AND project-switch CLI. `active_work` is fallback for non-TMUX only.

**Also committed (safe, additive):**
1. `_update_active_work()`: Added TTY session fallback for instance_id resolution
2. `session-init hook`: Propagates `claude_session_id` to TTY session file

**Commit:** `f9d607ed` (TTY fallback), Fixed in v1.6.6

### 11.15 Transaction File Deleted After POSTFLIGHT Breaks Compact (2026-02-21)

**Symptom:** After POSTFLIGHT closes a loop, compaction loses project context. post-compact
writes `active_work` pointing to wrong project. Sentinel blocks with "No PREFLIGHT".

**Root cause:** `clear_active_transaction()` deleted the transaction file immediately after
POSTFLIGHT. When compaction occurred, post-compact had no transaction file to read for
project context. It fell back to stale `active_work` data from a previous session.

**The problem sequence:**
1. POSTFLIGHT closes loop → `status="closed"` → file deleted
2. User continues work in same project (no new PREFLIGHT yet)
3. Compaction occurs
4. post-compact calls `_find_project_root()` → no transaction file exists
5. Falls back to stale `active_work` from old session → wrong project
6. Writes new `active_work` with wrong `project_path`
7. User's next PREFLIGHT attempt blocked because project context is wrong

**Fix:** Transaction files now persist as "project anchors" until overwritten by next PREFLIGHT.
1. `workflow_commands.py`: Removed `clear_active_transaction()` call from POSTFLIGHT handler
2. `sentinel-gate.py`: No longer deletes closed transactions (was backup purge)
3. `post-compact.py`: Uses closed transactions for project resolution (fallback to open)

**Design principle:** Closed transaction file serves two purposes:
- Open (`status="open"`): Active gating by Sentinel
- Closed (`status="closed"`): Project anchor for post-compact resolution

The file is only overwritten when a new PREFLIGHT starts a new transaction.

**Commit:** Fixed in v1.5.5 — Closed Transactions as Anchors

### 11.16 Auto-POSTFLIGHT From CHECK Doesn't Close Transaction File (2026-02-22)

**Symptom:** CHECK auto-triggers POSTFLIGHT on goal completion. Epistemic snapshot
written to DB, but transaction file stays `status="open"`. Statusline/Sentinel
still see an open transaction.

**Root cause:** POSTFLIGHT handler used a custom project resolution chain
(TTY→active_work→CWD) instead of canonical `get_active_project_path()`.

The failure path (historical — auto-POSTFLIGHT removed in 1.6.4):
1. CHECK called `_auto_postflight()` → spawned `empirica postflight-submit -` subprocess
2. Subprocess inherits `TMUX_PANE` (instance_id resolves correctly)
3. TTY session has `claude_session_id=None` (by design — CLI can't access it)
4. Without claude_session_id, can't find `active_work_{id}.json` → `resolved_project_path=None`
5. Falls back to `Path.cwd()` — **violates NO CWD FALLBACK rule**
6. If CWD is wrong (post-compact, Claude reset), can't find `.empirica/` → silent fail
7. DB snapshot written (uses session_id, not project_path) but transaction file untouched

**Fix:** Replace custom resolution with `get_active_project_path()`:
- P0: `instance_projects/tmux_N.json` (always available when TMUX_PANE set)
- P1: `active_work_{claude_session_id}.json` (fallback for non-TMUX)
- No CWD fallback

**Commit:** `72149c86`

### 11.17 Pytest Subprocess Tests Pollute Live Database (2026-02-22)

**Symptom:** Running `pytest` creates test sessions and goals in the live `sessions.db`.
`goals-list` shows dozens of "Test AI-first goal creation [...]" entries after test runs.

**Root cause:** `test_ai_agent_workflow.py` uses `subprocess.run(['empirica', ...])` which
inherits the parent environment. The subprocess resolves the database via:

1. `get_active_context()` → finds `instance_projects/tmux_N.json` → live project path
2. `get_session_db_path()` → returns live `sessions.db`
3. `resolve_session_db_path()` → also returns live `sessions.db`

`EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB` env var existed but was priority 3 (last) in `get_session_db_path()`
and not checked at all in `resolve_session_db_path()`. The live DB always won.

**Fix (3 parts):**

1. **`path_resolver.py`:** Moved `EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB` to priority 0 in both
   `get_session_db_path()` and `resolve_session_db_path()`. When explicitly set,
   it now wins over all instance-aware resolution. This also fixes the Docker use case
   documented in `README.md` (which previously didn't actually work if the container
   had a git repo).

2. **`test_ai_agent_workflow.py`:** Added `isolated_env` fixture that creates a temp
   `sessions.db` and passes `EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB` via subprocess env. Tests now write
   to the temp DB. TMUX_PANE is preserved so project path resolution still works.

3. **Priority chain update:**
   ```
   get_session_db_path():
     0. EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB (explicit override)
     1. Unified context (transaction → active_work → TTY → instance_projects)
     2. workspace.db lookup
     3. Git root based

   resolve_session_db_path():
     0. EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB (explicit override)
     1. instance_projects mapping
     2. TTY session
     3. get_session_db_path() fallthrough
   ```

**Verified:** After fix, running `pytest` twice produced 0 new test goals/sessions in live DB.

**Commit:** Fixed in v1.5.7 — Test Isolation EMPIRICA_SESSION_DB

### 11.18 SessionStart Hook Matchers Never Matched (2026-02-22)

**Symptom:** Instance isolation breaks when CWD-based resolution diverges from
project-switch binding. `session-init.py` never fires on new conversations.

**Root cause:** `~/.claude/settings.json` SessionStart hook matchers used invalid
trigger values:
- `"new|fresh"` → never matches (Claude Code triggers: `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`)
- `"compact"` → missed `resume` trigger (continued conversations)

This meant:
1. `session-init.py` **never fired via hooks** — only via manual invocation
2. `post-compact.py` only ran on compaction, not on conversation resume
3. `ewm-protocol-loader.py` only loaded on compaction events

**Why it appeared to work:** `post-compact.py` (on `"compact"` matcher) correctly
writes `instance_projects` and `active_work` files. Since most long sessions involve
compaction, isolation files were eventually created. `project-switch` also writes them.
The gap only showed when a fresh conversation started in a different CWD than the
bound project — `session-init` should have written the isolation files at startup
but never did.

**Fix:** Updated `~/.claude/settings.json` matchers:
```json
"SessionStart": [
  { "matcher": "compact|resume", "hooks": [...post-compact, ewm-protocol-loader...] },
  { "matcher": "startup",        "hooks": [...session-init, ewm-protocol-loader...] }
]
```

**Claude Code SessionStart triggers (authoritative):**
| Trigger | When |
|---------|------|
| `startup` | New conversation begins |
| `resume` | Existing conversation continued |
| `clear` | After `/clear` command |
| `compact` | After auto/manual context compaction |

**Prevention:** Verify hook trigger values against platform documentation, not intuition.

**Commit:** applied to `~/.claude/settings.json` (not in git — user config file)

### 11.19 Ghost Session Propagation in post-compact (2026-02-25)

**Symptom:** Statusline shows `[empirica-web:inactive]` despite hooks running successfully.
`instance_projects` and `active_work` reference a session_id that doesn't exist in any database.

**Root cause:** Session `7b56baa5` was created (likely in a different DB or deleted during cleanup)
but all isolation files still referenced it. When post-compact ran on `resume`:

1. `_get_empirica_session()` read `active_work` → found ghost session `7b56baa5`
2. `_get_session_phase_state("7b56baa5")` queried local DB → zero reflexes found
3. Zero reflexes → `is_complete = False` → routed to CHECK_GATE (not NEW_SESSION)
4. CHECK_GATE path does NOT create a new session — just re-propagates the ghost ID
5. Statusline queries `WHERE session_id = '7b56baa5' AND end_time IS NULL` → not found → "inactive"

**The self-reinforcing loop:** Each resume/compact re-reads the ghost from active_work,
fails to find it in DB, misinterprets as "mid-work incomplete session", and writes it back.
The ghost persists across unlimited compaction cycles.

**Fix:** Added ghost session detection in post-compact.py `main()`. After resolving
`empirica_session` from active_work, verify it exists in the local DB via
`SELECT 1 FROM sessions WHERE session_id = ?`. If not found, create a new session
and update all isolation files — bypassing the normal phase-state routing.

**Prevention:** Session existence check before using session_id from file-based state.
File-based state can reference sessions that no longer exist (cleanup, DB restore,
cross-DB creation). Always verify against the authoritative source (the database).

**Commit:** applied to `~/.claude/plugins/local/empirica/hooks/post-compact.py`

### 11.20 CLI Commands Use tmux-Only Instance ID (2026-03-19)

**Symptom:** CHECK records stored with `transaction_id=NULL`. Sentinel blocks all praxic
actions with "No valid CHECK found" despite CHECK returning `proceed`.

**Root cause:** `project-switch`, `session-create`, `transaction-adopt`, and
`write_tty_session()` constructed instance_id exclusively from `TMUX_PANE`. In X11,
macOS Terminal, or TTY-only environments, instance_id was `None`, so no
`instance_projects/{id}.json` was written. This broke the resolution chain:
`get_active_project_path()` → `read_active_transaction()` → CHECK `transaction_id`.

**Why it surfaced now:** Isolation hardening (v1.6.5–1.6.21) removed CWD fallbacks
and tightened resolution to be instance-aware. Correct in principle, but exposed
the latent tmux-only assumption in CLI commands.

**Fix:** All CLI commands now use canonical `get_instance_id()` which supports
tmux, X11 (`WINDOWID`), macOS Terminal (`TERM_SESSION_ID`), and TTY.
`tool-router.py` hook also fixed (had wrong format `tmux:{pane}` and no X11 support).

**Commit:** `dd4f823d`, `4c2b8266`

### 11.21 Subagent Detection Broken by Inherited Env Vars (2026-03-19)

**Symptom:** Explore/research subagents get full Sentinel gating (blocked by "No valid
CHECK found") instead of being exempted. Causes unbounded tool calls as subagents
struggle with noetic firewall they shouldn't face.

**Root cause:** Subagent exemption checked `active_session_{instance_suffix}`. But
subprocesses inherit env vars (`WINDOWID`, `TMUX_PANE`) from the parent, so
`_get_instance_suffix()` returns the same value for both parent and subagent.
The subagent finds the parent's `active_session` file and is treated as the parent.

**Fix:** Check `active_work_{claude_session_id}.json` instead. Subagents get a
different `claude_session_id` from Claude Code, so they won't have a matching file.
If `active_session` also exists (confirming parent was set up properly), the subagent
is exempted. If neither file exists, falls through to normal gating (fail-safe for
broken session-init).

**Commit:** `c74705c0`

### 11.22 Transaction Suffix Mismatch in Hook Context (2026-03-23)

**Symptom:** Sentinel blocks ALL praxic actions in Claude Code sessions. User cannot
write, edit, or execute anything. CHECK passes via CLI but sentinel-gate hook can't
find the transaction. Reported by Philipp on macOS with tmux.

**Root cause:** Transaction files are written by CLI commands where `TMUX_PANE` is
available (e.g., `active_transaction_tmux_5.json`). But Claude Code hooks don't
reliably inherit `TMUX_PANE` — `get_instance_id()` returns `None`, so
`_get_instance_suffix()` returns `""`, and the hook looks for
`active_transaction.json` which doesn't exist.

This is a reader/writer suffix mismatch: the writer has env var context the reader
lacks. Unlike 11.20 (where the writer was wrong), here both sides use the canonical
`get_instance_id()` correctly — but the env vars available differ between contexts.

**Fix:** Added `_find_transaction_file()` fallback to both `session_resolver.py` and
`sentinel-gate.py`. When the exact-suffix file doesn't exist, scans for any
`active_transaction_*.json` matching the current `session_id`. The scan is safe
because it's scoped by session_id — no cross-instance talk.

The fix is at the InstanceResolver level (`read_active_transaction_full()`) so all
consumers benefit automatically, plus mirrored in sentinel-gate.py which has its
own transaction lookup for performance reasons.

**Risk:** If multiple instances share a session_id (shouldn't happen in practice),
the scan could return the wrong instance's transaction file. Monitor for unexpected
cross-instance behavior after this change.

**Workaround (pre-fix):** `echo "false" > ~/.empirica/sentinel_enabled`

**Commit:** Fixed in v1.7.0

### 11.23 Cross-Project Session Bleed via Stale Context (2026-03-22)

**Symptom:** `session-create`, `goals-complete`, and Sentinel use wrong project's
database when working in a multi-project setup. Goals marked complete don't show
as complete in statusline. Sessions created in one project appear in another.

**Root cause:** `get_session_db_path()` calls `R.context()` which falls through the
priority chain (transaction → instance_projects → TTY session). When instance-keyed
files don't match (after restart, project switch, or tmux recreation), TTY session
or stale instance_projects return a DIFFERENT project's path. Since `get_session_db_path()`
trusts the context resolver unconditionally, `SessionDatabase()` connects to the wrong DB.

**Fix:** Added git-root cross-check to `get_session_db_path()`, gated behind
`EMPIRICA_CWD_RELIABLE=true` env var. Only activates when CWD is known reliable
(set by `session-init.py` after `os.chdir(project_root)`). Detects when context
project differs from git root and falls through to git-root-based resolution.
Sentinel hook does NOT use CWD cross-check (CWD unreliable in hooks per 11.10).

**Commit:** `7aade9e4`, `937bf15f`

### 11.24 Subagent Pollution + Post-Compact Auto-Heal Gap (2026-04-08)

**Symptom (in empirica-cortex after `/compact`):**
```
_validate_session_in_db: session cd738ee9... NOT FOUND in project-local DB:
  /home/yogapad/empirical-ai/empirica-cortex/.empirica/sessions/sessions.db
  Recent sessions in DB: [('8a7693e2', 'superpowers:code-reviewer'),
                          ('0592a9c3', 'Explore'),
                          ('ee07936a', 'general-purpose'), ...]
get_active_empirica_session_id: stale session in transaction: cd738ee9...
```
Statusline failed and PREFLIGHT couldn't find the parent session.

**Two intertwined root causes:**

1. **Subagents creating rows in main `sessions` table.** `SubagentStart` hook
   called `SessionDatabase.create_session()` for every Task spawn (Explore,
   general-purpose, superpowers:* etc), polluting the main table with rows
   that always had `parent_session_id` set. Subagent children were always
   newer than their parents, so the "Recent sessions in DB" diagnostic
   surfaced only subagent rows — masking the actual parent and making the
   error message misleading.

2. **`post-compact.py` `CONTINUE_TRANSACTION` branch never validated the
   session_id it propagated forward.** This is the unfinished half of
   **11.19**. That fix added `_validate_session_in_db` and wired it into
   the `CHECK_GATE` branch, but the open-transaction branch reads
   `tx_session_id = active_transaction.get('session_id') or empirica_session`
   and writes it to `active_work` / `active_transaction` without ever
   checking it exists in the current project's DB. When the parent was
   originally created in a different project (cross-project `--resume`),
   the cortex DB never got the row and every subsequent CLI command
   failed validation.

**Fix:**

- **Subagent isolation:** Migration 034 creates a dedicated
  `subagent_sessions` table. `SessionDatabase.create_subagent_session()`,
  `end_subagent_session()`, `get_subagent_session()`, and
  `list_subagents_for_parent()` write to and read from it. Subagent rows
  no longer touch the main `sessions` table; lineage is preserved via
  `parent_session_id`. The migration moves existing legacy subagent rows
  out automatically (status `completed` if they had `end_time`,
  `orphaned` otherwise). `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` hooks updated.

- **Post-compact auto-heal:** New
  `SessionDatabase.ensure_session_exists()` does an idempotent insert of
  a minimal session row preserving the caller-provided `session_id`,
  marked `session_notes='auto-healed by post-compact'`, also registered
  in `workspace.db` for cross-project visibility. `post-compact.py`'s
  `CONTINUE_TRANSACTION` branch now calls `_validate_session_in_db` on
  `tx_session_id` and heals before propagating forward. Heal failure is
  non-fatal and logged to stderr.

**Lessons learned:** When adding a validator to a hook with multiple
routing paths, audit ALL paths, not just the one that triggered the
original report. 11.19's fix added the right tool but wired it into one
branch; the bug returned six weeks later via the unwired branch with
the same symptoms. Defensive checklist for future validation work:

1. List every code path that writes the value being validated.
2. For each path, decide: validate-and-heal, validate-and-fail, or skip.
3. Document the decision (even "skip" — make it explicit).
4. Add a regression test that exercises EVERY path.

**Tests:** 13 new in `tests/test_subagent_sessions.py` covering schema,
migration, all repository methods, and `ensure_session_exists` idempotency.

**Commit:** `9dd4f39a2`

### 11.25 project-switch Auto-Heal Gap (2026-04-08)

**Symptom:** After `empirica project-switch <other_project>`, every CLI
command in the new project surfaces the validation diagnostic from
11.24:

```
_validate_session_in_db: session 26a05872... NOT FOUND in project-local DB
get_active_empirica_session_id: stale session in transaction: 26a05872...
```

The `active_work_<claude_session_id>.json` file points at a session
that doesn't exist in the new project's `sessions.db`. Discovered while
working on the 11.24 fix — caught my own session in flight.

**Root cause:** `handle_project_switch_command` (`project_commands.py:944-989`)
mirrors the parent session into the target project DB, but only if a
prior lookup against `global_sessions` returns a row matching the current
`instance_id` and `status='active'`. When that lookup misses (instance
ID mismatch from a tmux restart, status drift, or just a stale workspace
DB), `attached_session` stays `None`, the mirror block at line 948 is
skipped, and the active_work file is written with `empirica_session_id=None`
or stays pointing at the prior project's session_id.

This is the same bug class as 11.24 (validation gap on a code path
that propagates session_id forward) but in `project-switch` instead
of `post-compact`. The lessons-learned checklist from 11.24 explicitly
called out the failure mode: validators wired into one code path but
not all of them.

**Fix:** After the existing mirror logic, if `attached_session_id` is
still None, the project-switch handler now reads the existing
`active_work_<claude_session_id>.json` file and recovers its
`empirica_session_id` field as a fallback. Whatever session_id it ends
up with, it then calls `SessionDatabase.ensure_session_exists()` on the
target project's DB to guarantee the session row exists before
`_update_active_work` propagates the pointer forward. Idempotent — no-op
if the row already exists.

When the heal fires, the user sees:
```
🔄 Recovered session 26a05872 from active_work file
🩹 Auto-healed session 26a05872 into target project DB
```

**Lessons learned (revised from 11.24):** Audit ALL paths that propagate
a session_id, not just hooks. The original 11.24 checklist mentioned
"hooks with multiple routing paths" but the same logic applies to any
CLI command that writes session_id into shared state. Updated checklist:

1. List every code path (hook, CLI handler, daemon) that writes a
   session_id into `active_work`, `instance_projects`, transaction
   files, or any other shared state.
2. For each path, decide: validate-and-heal, validate-and-fail, or
   skip. Document the decision.
3. Add a regression test that exercises EVERY path.

**Commit:** (committed with project-switch fix below)

## By Design (Not Bugs)

### Orphaned Transaction After Terminal Restart

**Scenario:** Terminal closes, new session has different instance IDs, old transaction can't be found.

**Auto-adoption (v1.6.21+):** `session-init.py` now scans the CWD project's `.empirica/`
for any `active_transaction*.json` with `status: open` on startup. If found, it adopts the
most recent orphaned transaction by re-keying to the new instance suffix and reusing the session.
This is safe because session-init already resolved the correct project via CWD/git root.

**Manual recovery** (if auto-adoption fails):
```bash
# Option 1: Adopt the transaction (works for any instance type)
empirica transaction-adopt --from <old_instance_id>

# Option 2: Abandon it
rm {project}/.empirica/active_transaction_<old_suffix>.json

# Option 3: Close it properly
empirica postflight-submit --session-id <old_session_id> ...
```

### project-switch Triggers POSTFLIGHT

**Behavior:** `project-switch` auto-triggers POSTFLIGHT on source project.
**Status:** By design - loops should close when switching projects.

---

## Common Failure Patterns

### CWD Reset by Claude Code

**Symptom:** Commands fail because they look in wrong project
**Fix:** Use TTY/instance session's project_path, not CWD

### Stale TTY Session

**Symptom:** Terminal closed and reopened, old session data used
**Fix:** `write_tty_session()` on session-create overwrites stale data

### Wrong Instance's Transaction

**Symptom:** Instance A sees instance B's transaction
**Fix:** Instance suffix on transaction files (`active_transaction_{suffix}.json`)

### Sentinel Blocks `cd && empirica check-submit`

**Symptom:** Sentinel blocks command chains with `&&`
**Fix:** Added special handling for `&&` chains with safe empirica commands

## Debugging Checklist

1. **Check instance_id:** `python3 -c "from empirica.utils.session_resolver import get_instance_id; print(get_instance_id())"`
   - tmux: `tmux_N` | X11: `x11:NNNNN` | macOS: `term:XXXX` | TTY: `term_pts_N`
2. **Check instance_projects file exists:** `ls ~/.empirica/instance_projects/`
3. **Check session matches:** Compare session_id in instance_projects vs active_transaction
4. **Check project_path:** Is it pointing to the right project?
5. **Check transaction status:** Is it `"open"` or closed?
6. **Check active_work exists (for subagent detection):** `ls ~/.empirica/active_work_*.json`

```bash
# Quick diagnostic
echo "=== Instance ID ===" && python3 -c "from empirica.utils.session_resolver import get_instance_id, _get_instance_suffix; print(f'id={get_instance_id()} suffix={_get_instance_suffix()}')"
echo "=== Instance Projects ===" && cat ~/.empirica/instance_projects/*.json 2>/dev/null
echo "=== Active Transaction ===" && cat .empirica/active_transaction_*.json 2>/dev/null
echo "=== TTY Session ===" && cat ~/.empirica/tty_sessions/$(tty | tr '/' '-' | sed 's/^-//').json 2>/dev/null
echo "=== Active Work ===" && ls -la ~/.empirica/active_work_*.json 2>/dev/null
```
