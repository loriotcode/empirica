# Instance Isolation Architecture

Core concepts and file taxonomy for multi-instance isolation.

## The One Rule

> **Hooks write. Everything else reads.**

Hooks have full context (`claude_session_id` from stdin + `TMUX_PANE` from env).
CLI commands, Sentinel, statusline, and MCP are **readers** — they resolve project
context from files that hooks wrote.

The sole exception is **`project-switch`**, which writes to `instance_projects` and
`tty_sessions` as a **signal** to hooks. It cannot write `active_work` because it
doesn't know `claude_session_id`. This is fine — `instance_projects` is read first.

## File Taxonomy

### 1. Instance Projects (tmux) — PRIMARY

**Location:** `~/.empirica/instance_projects/tmux_N.json`
**Key:** `TMUX_PANE` environment variable (e.g., `%4` → `tmux_4`)
**Written by:** Hooks (session-init, post-compact) AND `project-switch` CLI
**Read by:** Everyone (hooks, CLI, statusline, Sentinel)

```json
{
  "project_path": "/home/user/my-project",
  "claude_session_id": "fad66571-1bde-4ee1-aa0d-e9d3dfd8e833",
  "empirica_session_id": "2bc1da78-2a28-4745-b75b-f021d563d819",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-13T01:00:00"
}
```

**Purpose:** Links tmux pane → project. **Most current source** because it's the only
file writable by both hooks AND the project-switch CLI. In TMUX environments this is
the authoritative source.

### 2. Active Work Files (Claude Code) — FALLBACK

**Location:** `~/.empirica/active_work_{claude_session_id}.json`
**Key:** Claude Code conversation UUID (from hook stdin)
**Written by:** Hooks ONLY (session-init, post-compact)

```json
{
  "project_path": "/home/user/my-project",
  "folder_name": "my-project",
  "claude_session_id": "fad66571-1bde-4ee1-aa0d-e9d3dfd8e833",
  "empirica_session_id": "2bc1da78-2a28-4745-b75b-f021d563d819",
  "source": "post-compact",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-13T01:00:00"
}
```

**Purpose:** Links Claude conversation → project. Fallback for non-TMUX environments
where `instance_id` is unavailable. **Cannot be updated by project-switch** (CLI
doesn't know claude_session_id), so may be stale after a project-switch.

### 3. TTY Sessions (CLI/MCP)

**Location:** `~/.empirica/tty_sessions/pts-N.json`
**Key:** TTY device name (from `tty` command)
**Written by:** CLI commands (session-create, project-switch)

```json
{
  "claude_session_id": null,
  "empirica_session_id": "2bc1da78-2a28-4745-b75b-f021d563d819",
  "project_path": "/home/user/my-project",
  "tty_key": "pts-6",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-06T16:18:42",
  "pid": 1900034
}
```

**Purpose:** Links terminal → project. Primary isolation for non-Claude-Code users (MCP, direct CLI).

### 4. Transaction Files (Per-Project)

**Location:** `{project}/.empirica/active_transaction_{instance_id}.json`
**Key:** `instance_id` (e.g., `tmux_4`, `term_pts_6`, `default`)
**Written by:** PREFLIGHT command

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "e04ad48e-3c2b-48ef-96be-5ebcf86746c6",
  "session_id": "2bc1da78-2a28-4745-b75b-f021d563d819",
  "preflight_timestamp": 1770391133.159,
  "status": "open",
  "project_path": "/home/user/my-project"
}
```

**Purpose:** Tracks open epistemic transaction. Survives memory compaction.

## Resolution Priority Chain

All components use `get_active_project_path()` — the single canonical function.

```
Priority 0: instance_projects/tmux_N.json    (TMUX_PANE → instance_id)
    ↓
Priority 1: active_work_{claude_session_id}.json  (fallback for non-TMUX)
    ↓
❌ NO CWD FALLBACK - return None, fail explicitly
```

**Why instance_projects first:** It's the only file writable by BOTH hooks AND
project-switch CLI. After `project-switch`, instance_projects reflects user intent
immediately. `active_work` may be stale (only hooks can update it, and no hook
fires between project-switch and the next tool use).

**Why no self-heal:** If the two files disagree after project-switch, that's
expected and correct — instance_projects has the newer data. No file should
overwrite another. The disagreement resolves naturally when the next SessionStart
hook fires and writes both files consistently.

**Non-TMUX environments:** `instance_id` is `None`, so instance_projects isn't
found. Falls through to `active_work`, which hooks wrote at session start.
project-switch in non-TMUX still works because it writes to `tty_sessions` and
other CLI resolution paths.

## Multi-Instance Without tmux

The isolation mechanism depends on each Claude Code instance getting a unique
`instance_id`. How this works varies by terminal setup:

| Setup | Isolation | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **tmux panes** | ✅ Full | Each pane has unique `TMUX_PANE` → unique `instance_projects/tmux_N.json` |
| **Separate terminal windows** | ✅ Full | Each window has unique `WINDOWID` → unique `instance_projects/x11_N.json` |
| **Tabs in same terminal** | ⚠️ Shared | Tabs share the same `WINDOWID` → same `instance_projects` file → last writer wins |
| **Single terminal** | ✅ N/A | Only one instance, no conflict |

### Tabs in Same Terminal (Known Limitation)

Multiple Claude Code instances running in **tabs of the same terminal emulator**
(e.g., GNOME Terminal tabs, iTerm2 tabs) share the same X11 `WINDOWID`. This
means `project-switch` in one tab overwrites the `instance_projects` file for
all tabs in that window. The `active_work.json` (generic, no session suffix)
is also shared.

**Symptoms:**
- Statusline shows wrong project after switching in another tab
- Sentinel may gate based on wrong project's transaction state
- `project-bootstrap` loads context from wrong project

**Workarounds:**
1. **Use separate terminal windows** (not tabs) — each gets its own `WINDOWID`
2. **Use tmux** — each pane gets its own `TMUX_PANE`, purpose-built for this
3. **Single project per terminal window** — avoid `project-switch` across tabs

**Why not fix this?** Tabs in the same terminal share the same X11 window ID at
the OS level. There is no environment variable or file descriptor that uniquely
identifies a tab. The `claude_session_id` (from Claude Code's stdin) IS unique
per instance, but CLI commands (including `project-switch`) don't have access to
it — only hooks do. This is a fundamental platform limitation.

## Ownership Model

| Component | Writes | Reads | Has claude_session_id? |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| **Hooks** (session-init, post-compact) | `active_work`, `instance_projects`, `tty_sessions` | All | Yes (stdin) |
| **CLI** (project-switch) | `instance_projects`, `tty_sessions` | All | **No** |
| **CLI** (session-create) | `tty_sessions` | All | **No** |
| **PREFLIGHT** | `active_transaction` | All | No |
| **Statusline** | Nothing | All | No |
| **Sentinel** | Nothing | All | Yes (stdin) |

**The asymmetry that matters:** Hooks have `claude_session_id` (from stdin).
CLI commands do not. This means:

- `active_work_{claude_session_id}.json` → **only hooks can write** (need the key)
- `instance_projects/tmux_N.json` → **hooks AND project-switch can write** (keyed by TMUX_PANE)
- `tty_sessions/pts-N.json` → **hooks AND CLI can write** (keyed by TTY device)

**Therefore instance_projects is the most complete source** — it's updated by every
writer in the system. active_work can go stale after project-switch because the CLI
can't update it.

**NEVER self-heal between files.** If `active_work` and `instance_projects` disagree,
instance_projects is more current (it was updated by project-switch). Overwriting
instance_projects from active_work reverses the user's project-switch — this was
bug #11.14.

  Writes:
  • instance_projects  ← signals project change
  • tty_sessions       ← signals project change
  • CANNOT write active_work (no key)
```

**After project-switch:** `instance_projects` has the new project, `active_work` has
the old project. This is expected. `instance_projects` is read first, so the correct
project is used. `active_work` gets updated when the next SessionStart hook fires.

## Design Decisions

### No File-Based Statusline Caching

**Decision (2026-02-06):** Removed file-based statusline caching.

**Rationale:**
- Statusline only refreshes on PREFLIGHT/CHECK/POSTFLIGHT (not every second)
- DB queries are fast (local SQLite)
- Cache caused stale data bugs when projects changed
- Single source of truth (DB) is simpler and more reliable

**What remains:**
- TTY session files (not cache — actual session linkage)
- Transaction files (not cache — transaction state)
- Instance project files (not cache — pane-to-project mapping)
