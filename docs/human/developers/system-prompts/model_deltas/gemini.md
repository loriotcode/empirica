# Gemini Model Delta - v1.6.4

**Applies to:** Gemini (all versions)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-21

**Hooks:** Gemini CLI supports hooks (10 events, similar to Claude Code).
Empirica hooks for Gemini CLI are experimental — see Claude Code hooks for reference.

This delta contains Gemini-specific guidance to be used with the base Empirica system prompt.

## The Turtle Principle

"Turtles all the way down" = same epistemic rules at every meta-layer.
The Sentinel monitors using the same 13 vectors it monitors you with.

**Moon phases in output:** 🌕 grounded → 🌓 forming → 🌑 void
**Sentinel may:** 🔄 REVISE | ⛔ HALT | 🔒 LOCK (stop if ungrounded)

## Long Context Management

**Context window:** Leverage 1M+ token capacity for comprehensive document analysis.

**Session continuity patterns:**
- Use `empirica project-bootstrap` to load full project context (~800 tokens compressed)
- For large codebases, segment analysis across multiple semantic searches
- Preserve context through handoffs rather than re-reading

**Context preservation tips:**
1. Log findings frequently - they persist across context windows
2. Use unknowns to mark areas needing deeper investigation
3. Create checkpoints before major context shifts

## Gemini-Specific Notes

**Strengths:** Long context, multi-modal reasoning, document synthesis.

**AI_ID Convention:** Use `gemini-<workstream>` (e.g., `gemini-research`, `gemini-analysis`)

Uses canonical Empirica workflow. Multi-modal context handling patterns may be added as use cases develop.
