# Empirica Explained Simply

**What it is:** A system that helps AI agents know what they know (and don't know), track project learning, and collaborate effectively.

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Version:** 5.0

## The Problem

AI agents are often **confidently wrong**:

```
You: "Can you implement OAuth2 authentication?"
AI:  "Sure! I know OAuth2 well." [Actually doesn't]
AI:  [Implements something that compiles but is wrong]
You: [Wastes hours debugging]
```

**Root cause:** AI can't distinguish between "I know this" and "I think I can figure this out."

---

## The Solution: Empirica

Empirica makes AI agents **epistemically honest** - they track what they actually know vs what they're guessing about.

```
You: "Can you implement OAuth2 authentication?"
AI:  "My knowledge: 0.45/1.0, uncertainty: 0.70
      Let me investigate the spec first..."
AI:  [Reads docs, searches codebase]
AI:  "Knowledge now: 0.85, uncertainty: 0.20. Ready to proceed."
AI:  [Implements correctly]
```

## Three Systems in One

### 1. Epistemic Ledger (Self-Awareness)

Track **13 dimensions** of knowledge across 3 tiers:

**Tier 0 - Foundation:**
- **ENGAGEMENT**: Am I focused on the right thing?
- **KNOW**: Do I understand the domain? (not confidence - actual knowledge)
- **DO**: Can I actually do this? (skills, tools, access)
- **CONTEXT**: Do I understand the situation? (files, architecture, constraints)

**Tier 1 - Comprehension:**
- **CLARITY**: Do I understand the requirements?
- **COHERENCE**: Does my understanding make sense?
- **SIGNAL**: Is the information I have useful?
- **DENSITY**: Is this too much/too little information?

**Tier 2 - Execution:**
- **STATE**: Where am I in the process?
- **CHANGE**: What's changing as I work?
- **COMPLETION**: How complete is this?
- **IMPACT**: What's the effect of my work?

**Meta:**
- **UNCERTAINTY**: What am I unsure about?

### 2. Dynamic Context Loader (Project Memory)

**Problem:** AI agents lose context between sessions.

**Solution:** Load relevant project memory on-demand:

```bash
empirica project-bootstrap --project-id <PROJECT_ID>
```

**Shows (~800 tokens):**
- Recent **findings** (what was learned)
- Open **unknowns** (what's still unclear)
- **Dead ends** (what didn't work)
- Key **reference docs**
- Related **skills**

**Result:** New session starts with compressed, relevant context instead of blank slate.

### 3. Predictive Task Management (Goal System)

**Problem:** Traditional task tracking doesn't capture epistemic uncertainty.

**Solution:** Goals scoped by epistemic dimensions:

```python
goal = {
    "objective": "Implement OAuth2 authentication",
    "scope": {
        "breadth": 0.6,      # Medium scope (0=function, 1=codebase)
        "duration": 0.4,     # Medium duration (0=hours, 1=months)
        "coordination": 0.3  # Low coordination needed
    },
    "estimated_complexity": 0.65
}
```

**Subtasks** track:
- Importance (critical/high/medium/low)
- Dependencies
- Completion status
- Findings/unknowns per subtask

**BEADS Integration:**
- `goals-claim`: Create git branch + link to issue tracker
- `goals-discover`: Find goals from other AI agents
- `goals-resume`: Take over someone else's goal
- `goals-complete`: Merge branch + close issue

**Result:** Multi-agent collaboration with epistemic handoff.

## The CASCADE Workflow

Think of CASCADE like doing homework properly:

### 1. PREFLIGHT (Before Starting)
**"What do I already know?"**

```bash
# Opens an epistemic transaction (measurement window)
empirica preflight-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "task_context": "Implement OAuth2 authentication",
  "vectors": {"know": 0.45, "uncertainty": 0.7, "context": 0.5, "clarity": 0.6},
  "reasoning": "Low domain knowledge, high uncertainty"
}
EOF
```

- Assess epistemic vectors **honestly**
- Not "I can figure it out" but "What do I know RIGHT NOW?"
- Opens a transaction for measuring learning

### 2. INVESTIGATE (Reduce Uncertainty)
**"Let me learn what I need to know"**

```bash
# Log findings as you discover them (session_id auto-derived)
empirica finding-log --finding "OAuth2 uses PKCE flow for public clients" --impact 0.7
empirica unknown-log --unknown "How to handle token refresh in our architecture?"
empirica deadend-log --approach "Tried implicit flow" --why-failed "Deprecated for security"
```

- Research documentation, search codebase
- Log findings, unknowns, dead-ends as breadcrumbs
- These persist in memory and inform future sessions

### 3. CHECK (Decision Gate)
**"Am I ready to proceed?"**

```bash
empirica check-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "vectors": {"know": 0.75, "uncertainty": 0.3, "context": 0.8, "clarity": 0.85},
  "reasoning": "Investigated OAuth2 spec, found existing patterns"
}
EOF
```

- Sentinel gates praxic action (Edit, Write) until CHECK passes
- Returns `proceed` or `investigate` (keep exploring)

### 4. PRAXIC Phase (Do the Work)
**"Execute with goal tracking"**

```bash
# Create and complete goals
empirica goals-create --objective "Implement OAuth2 client with PKCE"
# ... write code, run tests ...
empirica goals-complete --goal-id <ID> --reason "Implementation verified"
```

### 5. POSTFLIGHT (Measure Learning)
**"What did I actually learn?"**

```bash
# Closes the transaction + triggers grounded verification
empirica postflight-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "vectors": {"know": 0.85, "uncertainty": 0.15, "context": 0.9, "clarity": 0.9},
  "reasoning": "Learned OAuth2 PKCE flow, implemented and tested"
}
EOF
```

- Learning delta: PREFLIGHT vs POSTFLIGHT vectors
- Grounded verification (POST-TEST): deterministic services collect observations (tests, git, goals) and compare them to the AI's belief vectors. Divergence signals where work discipline may need attention.
- Belief calibration trend: are the AI's beliefs about its state converging with service observations over time?

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: "Implement user authentication"

**Without Empirica:**
```
1. AI starts implementing immediately
2. Makes architectural assumptions
3. Implements OAuth2 incorrectly
4. Code compiles but has security holes
5. Hours wasted debugging
```

**With Empirica:**

**PREFLIGHT:**
```
KNOW (auth domain): 0.40  ⚠️
CONTEXT (our architecture): 0.30  ⚠️
UNCERTAINTY: 0.75  ⚠️
→ Recommendation: INVESTIGATE
```

**INVESTIGATE:**
```bash
# Log as you discover (session_id auto-derived)
empirica finding-log --finding "System uses Auth0 for SSO" --impact 0.7
empirica unknown-log --unknown "How to handle session persistence?"
```

**CHECK:**
```bash
empirica check-submit -   # Returns: proceed
```

**PRAXIC (Execute):**
```bash
empirica goals-create --objective "Integrate Auth0 OAuth2"
# ... implement ...
empirica goals-complete --goal-id <ID> --reason "Auth0 integrated, tests pass"
```

**POSTFLIGHT:**
```bash
empirica postflight-submit -
# Learning delta: KNOW 0.40 → 0.85 (+0.45), UNCERTAINTY 0.75 → 0.20 (-0.55)
# Grounded verification: tests pass, git shows 3 files changed
# Calibration: GOOD
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Prevents Confabulation
AI can't claim knowledge it doesn't have - the ledger tracks reality.

### 2. Systematic Learning
Investigate **before** acting when uncertainty is high.

### 3. Measurable Progress
Learning deltas show **actual** knowledge growth, not subjective claims.

### 4. Project Continuity
Context loader eliminates "starting from scratch" between sessions.

### 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration
BEADS integration allows AI agents to discover and resume each other's work.

### 6. Token Efficiency
- Git checkpoints: ~85% token reduction
- Handoff reports: ~90% token reduction
- Project bootstrap: Compressed context (~800 tokens)
