# Epistemic Transaction Workflow API Reference

**Version:** 1.8.6
**Purpose:** Epistemic measurement phases for AI self-assessment, domain compliance, and grounded calibration

---

## Overview

The epistemic transaction workflow defines the epistemic measurement phases that track AI knowledge state across work cycles:

```
PREFLIGHT ──► CHECK ──► POSTFLIGHT ──► POST-TEST ──► COMPLIANCE
    │           │            │              │              │
 Baseline    Sentinel     Learning      Evidence       Domain
 Assessment    Gate        Delta       Collection     Checklist
                                      (observed)      (B2 loop)
```

**Key concept:** The PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT cycle is a **measurement window** (epistemic transaction), not a goal boundary. Between measurements, epistemic state is wave-like (continuous). PREFLIGHT/POSTFLIGHT collapse it to particles (discrete vectors).

---

## Transaction-First Architecture

After PREFLIGHT, most commands auto-derive `--session-id` from the active transaction. The CLI uses `get_active_empirica_session_id()` with priority:

1. Active transaction (`active_transaction_*.json`)
2. active_work file
3. instance_projects file

**File tracking:**
- `{project}/.empirica/active_transaction_{suffix}.json` — Transaction state (survives compaction)
- `~/.empirica/active_work_{claude_session_id}.json` — Session context

---

## Epistemic Vectors

All transaction commands accept these vectors (0.0-1.0):

| Vector | Description | Typical Range |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `know` | Confidence in current knowledge | 0.4-0.9 |
| `uncertainty` | Epistemic uncertainty level | 0.1-0.6 |
| `do` | Ability to execute the task | 0.3-0.9 |
| `completion` | Progress toward goal (phase-aware) | 0.0-1.0 |
| `context` | Understanding of current situation | 0.5-0.95 |
| `clarity` | Clarity of requirements | 0.5-0.9 |
| `impact` | Expected impact of work | 0.3-0.9 |
| `change` | Magnitude of changes made | 0.0-0.8 |
| `state` | Codebase state understanding | 0.5-0.9 |
| `density` | Information density of session | 0.3-0.8 |
| `signal` | Signal-to-noise ratio | 0.4-0.9 |
| `coherence` | Logical consistency | 0.6-0.95 |
| `engagement` | Task engagement level | 0.5-0.9 |

**Readiness gate:** Dynamic thresholds from Sentinel (static fallback: know >= 0.70, uncertainty <= 0.35)

---

## Commands

### `preflight-submit`

Submit baseline epistemic assessment before work begins. Opens an epistemic transaction.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# AI-first mode (recommended)
empirica preflight-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "session_id": "auto",
  "task_description": "Implement user authentication",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.6,
    "uncertainty": 0.4,
    "do": 0.3,
    "completion": 0.0,
    "context": 0.7
  },
  "reasoning": "Familiar with auth patterns but need to investigate this codebase"
}
EOF

# Legacy flag mode
empirica preflight-submit \
  --session-id <ID> \
  --vectors '{"know": 0.6, "uncertainty": 0.4}' \
  --reasoning "..."
```

**Input Schema:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string (UUID or 'auto')",
  "task_description": "string (what you intend to do)",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.0-1.0,
    "uncertainty": 0.0-1.0,
    "do": 0.0-1.0,
    "completion": 0.0-1.0,
    "context": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "reasoning": "string (explanation of epistemic state)"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "transaction_id": "def456...",
  "checkpoint_id": "git-sha",
  "message": "PREFLIGHT assessment submitted",
  "vectors_submitted": 5,
  "previous_transaction_feedback": {
    "calibration_score": 0.18,
    "grounded_coverage": 0.69,
    "overestimate_tendency": ["do", "state"],
    "underestimate_tendency": ["density", "uncertainty"],
    "note": "Directional feedback — drift patterns from deterministic proxies, not ground truth"
  },
  "sentinel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "decision": "proceed"
  }
}
```

**Side Effects:**
- Creates epistemic transaction file
- Records baseline vectors to database and git notes
- Loads learning prior (calibration adjustments from history)
- Returns pattern warnings if approaching known dead-ends

---

### `check-submit`

Validate readiness to proceed with action (NOETIC → PRAXIC gate).

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# AI-first mode (recommended)
empirica check-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "session_id": "auto",
  "action_description": "Write authentication middleware",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.8,
    "uncertainty": 0.2,
    "context": 0.85,
    "scope": 0.4
  },
  "reasoning": "Investigated codebase, found auth patterns, ready to implement"
}
EOF
```

**Input Schema:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "action_description": "string (what you're about to do)",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.0-1.0,
    "uncertainty": 0.0-1.0,
    "context": 0.0-1.0,
    "scope": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "reasoning": "string",
  "round": "integer (optional, for tracking)"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "decision": "proceed",
  "round": 1,
  "metacog": {
    "computed_decision": "proceed",
    "raw_vectors": {"know": 0.8, "uncertainty": 0.2},
    "bias_corrections": {"know": -0.03, "uncertainty": 0.04},
    "readiness_gate": "know>=0.70 AND uncertainty<=0.35",
    "gate_passed": true
  },
  "sentinel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "decision": "proceed"
  },
  "blindspots": {
    "count": 0
  }
}
```

**Decision Values:**
| Decision | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `proceed` | Gate passed, continue to praxic phase |
| `investigate` | Confidence too low, stay in noetic phase |
| `proceed_with_caution` | Edge case, proceed but monitor closely |

**Side Effects:**
- Creates CHECK checkpoint snapshot
- Evaluates readiness gate
- Checks for blindspots
- Sentinel may override decision

---

### `postflight-submit`

Record learning delta and create epistemic snapshot. Closes the transaction.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# AI-first mode (recommended)
empirica postflight-submit - << 'EOF'
{
  "session_id": "auto",
  "task_description": "Implemented JWT authentication",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.88,
    "uncertainty": 0.12,
    "do": 0.9,
    "completion": 1.0,
    "context": 0.85
  },
  "summary": "Implemented JWT auth with RS256 signing, added refresh token support"
}
EOF
```

**Input Schema:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "task_description": "string",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.0-1.0,
    "uncertainty": 0.0-1.0,
    "do": 0.0-1.0,
    "completion": 0.0-1.0,
    "context": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "summary": "string (what was accomplished)"
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "checkpoint_id": "git-sha",
  "postflight_confidence": 0.88,
  "deltas": {
    "know": 0.28,
    "uncertainty": -0.28,
    "do": 0.6,
    "completion": 1.0
  },
  "calibration": {
    "verification_id": "uuid",
    "evidence_count": 5,
    "sources": ["artifacts", "sentinel", "git"],
    "grounded_coverage": 0.31,
    "calibration_score": 0.29,
    "gaps": {"know": 0.38, "uncertainty": 0.12}
  },
  "storage_layers": {
    "sqlite": true,
    "git_notes": true,
    "bayesian_beliefs": true,
    "episodic_memory": true,
    "qdrant_memory": true,
    "grounded_calibration": true
  },
  "snapshot": {
    "created": true,
    "snapshot_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Side Effects:**
- Closes epistemic transaction (sets status=closed, deletes hook_counters file)
- Computes learning deltas (POSTFLIGHT - PREFLIGHT)
- Updates Bayesian beliefs for calibration
- Creates epistemic snapshot for session replay
- Syncs to Qdrant memory (if configured)
- Runs grounded calibration (POST-TEST) with deterministic service observations
- Exports learning trajectory to `.breadcrumbs.yaml`

---

## Grounded Calibration (POST-TEST)

POSTFLIGHT automatically triggers evidence collection from deterministic services.
These services produce **observed vectors** — information that the AI uses to
reason to a **grounded state** with explicit rationale. The services inform;
they do not score. The AI gives the score.

**Three-vector model (v1.8.6):**
| Vector Set | Source | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `self_assessed` | AI's PREFLIGHT/POSTFLIGHT vectors | The AI's predictions |
| `observed` | Deterministic services (below) | Pure information — what each service saw |
| `grounded` | AI's reasoned synthesis with rationale | The authoritative epistemic state |

**Evidence Sources — populate observed vectors:**
| Source | Signal Type | Vectors Informed |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| pytest results | OBJECTIVE | know, do, clarity |
| Git metrics | OBJECTIVE | do, change, state |
| Code quality (ruff, radon, pyright) | OBJECTIVE | clarity, coherence, density, signal, know, do |
| Goal/subtask completion | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | completion, do, know |
| Artifact ratios | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | know, uncertainty, signal |
| Issue resolution | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | impact, signal |
| Sentinel decisions | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | context, uncertainty |
| Codebase model (entities, facts, constraints) | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | know, context, signal, density, coherence |
| Triage metrics (transaction-scoped) | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | do, completion, change |
| Non-git file changes | SEMI_OBJECTIVE | state, change, do |

**Meta vectors:** uncertainty is computed from the OTHER 12 vectors' coverage and
gap magnitudes (not from direct evidence sources).

**Ungroundable vectors:** engagement (no objective signal)

## Domain Compliance Loop (v1.8.6)

When `domain` and `criticality` are set in PREFLIGHT, POSTFLIGHT runs the
domain checklist via the compliance loop:

1. `DomainRegistry.resolve(work_type, domain, criticality)` → `Checklist`
2. `ServiceRegistry.run(check_id, context)` for each required check
3. Results stored in `compliance_checks` table
4. Status: `complete` (all pass) | `iteration_needed` (failures) | `max_iterations_exceeded`

**Check-outcome Brier scoring (B4):** If the AI predicted `P(check passes)` in
PREFLIGHT via `predicted_check_outcomes`, the compliance response includes a
`check_brier` block measuring prediction accuracy. This is falsifiable ground
truth — test passing/failing IS the outcome. The AI's prediction accuracy is
the calibration signal.

**CLI commands:** `domain-list`, `domain-show`, `domain-resolve`, `domain-validate`

## Python API

```python
from empirica.cli.command_handlers.workflow_commands import (
    handle_preflight_submit_command,
    handle_check_submit_command,
    handle_postflight_submit_command,
)

# Or use the database directly
from empirica.data.session_database import SessionDatabase

db = SessionDatabase()

# Record PREFLIGHT
db.record_checkpoint(
    session_id=session_id,
    checkpoint_type='preflight',
    vectors={'know': 0.6, 'uncertainty': 0.4},
    reasoning='Initial assessment'
)

# Record POSTFLIGHT
db.record_checkpoint(
    session_id=session_id,
    checkpoint_type='postflight',
    vectors={'know': 0.85, 'uncertainty': 0.15},
    reasoning='Completed investigation'
)
```

## Transaction Lifecycle

```
1. session-create → Creates Empirica session
2. PREFLIGHT → Opens transaction, baseline vectors
   ↓
3. Work phase (noetic investigation, praxic action)
   - Log findings, unknowns, dead-ends
   - Complete subtasks, goals
   ↓
4. CHECK → Gate decision (proceed/investigate)
   ↓
5. POSTFLIGHT → Close transaction, learning delta
   ↓
6. POST-TEST → Grounded calibration (automatic)
```

**Transactions survive compaction:** The transaction file persists across Claude Code session boundaries. A new session will pick up an open transaction.

---

## Sentinel Integration

The Sentinel gate enforces the epistemic transaction workflow:

1. **PreToolUse hooks** block praxic tools (Edit/Write/Bash) until CHECK passes
2. **Session hooks** auto-create sessions and bootstrap projects
3. **POSTFLIGHT hooks** capture learning at session end

**Pause Sentinel:**
```bash
touch ~/.empirica/sentinel_paused   # Pause
rm ~/.empirica/sentinel_paused      # Unpause
```

**Configuration:**

File-based (preferred — dynamically settable):
```bash
echo "false" > ~/.empirica/sentinel_enabled   # Disable sentinel
echo "true" > ~/.empirica/sentinel_enabled    # Re-enable sentinel
```

Environment variables (fallback — requires session restart):
```bash
EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_MODE=controller   # Active blocking (default)
EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_MODE=observer     # Log-only (no blocking)
EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_LOOPING=false     # Disable investigate loops
```

---

## Provenance Graph (1.8.6+)

Artifacts can be linked into a source-finding-decision traceability chain:

```bash
# Log a source, capture its ID
empirica source-add --title "API docs" --source-type doc --url "https://..."

# Log a finding WITH source provenance
empirica finding-log --finding "Auth uses JWT RS256" --source <source-id>

# Log a decision WITH evidence (finding IDs)
empirica decision-log --choice "Use middleware factory" \
  --rationale "Enables per-route config" \
  --evidence <finding-id-1> --evidence <finding-id-2>

# Resolve an unknown WITH the finding that answered it
empirica unknown-resolve --unknown-id <id> --finding <finding-id>
```

**CLI flags:** `--source` (finding-log, repeatable), `--evidence` (decision-log,
repeatable), `--finding` (unknown-resolve). All optional — omitting them still
works, the provenance link is just absent.

**MCP params:** `source_ids` (array), `evidence_refs` (array),
`resolution_finding_id` (string).

**Compliance checks:** `recommendation_traceability` (decisions cite evidence),
`finding_sourced` (findings cite sources), `provenance_depth` (full chain exists).

## Best Practices

1. **Always PREFLIGHT before investigation** — Establishes baseline for learning measurement
2. **CHECK before major actions** — Gate prevents premature praxic work
3. **POSTFLIGHT honestly** — Accurate vectors enable calibration improvement
4. **Log artifacts with provenance** — finding-log --source, decision-log --evidence
5. **Multiple goals per transaction is fine** — Transactions measure coherent work chunks
6. **Natural commit points** — Close transaction at confidence inflection, topic pivot, or context shift
7. **Commit before POSTFLIGHT** — Uncommitted work is invisible to grounded calibration
