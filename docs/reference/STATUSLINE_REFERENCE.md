## Overview

The Empirica statusline renders your current epistemic state in the Claude Code status bar. It reads vectors and session state from the local SQLite DB on every render — no model API calls, no network. If you see nothing, the script didn't run; if you see `[empirica] OFF-RECORD`, it ran but sentinel is paused.

Four display modes are available. Default is the one most users see.

---

## Display Modes

Set via `EMPIRICA_STATUS_MODE` env var. Default is `default`.

| Mode | Sections | When to use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `basic` | confidence + threshold | Minimal — just the headline |
| `default` | confidence + threshold + open counts + phase + K/C + Δ + ctx% | General use |
| `learning` | confidence + threshold + open counts + phase + all 5 key vectors + Δ | When focusing on vector evolution |
| `full` | `[project:ai@sid]` + goal progress + phase + all vectors + Δ | Deep debugging / handoff review |

```bash
export EMPIRICA_STATUS_MODE=learning
```

---

## Default Mode — Segment-by-Segment

Example: `⚡83% ↕70% │ 🎯0 ❓0 │ POST ⚙82% │ K:80% C:85% │ Δ ✓ │ 58%ctx`

The `│` is a visual separator. Everything else encodes state.

### 1. Confidence — `⚡83%`

Weighted composite of your epistemic vectors:

```
confidence = 0.40 · know
           + 0.30 · (1 − uncertainty)
           + 0.20 · context
           + 0.10 · completion
```

Tiered emoji maps to the value:

| Emoji | Range | Color |
|-------|-------|-------|
| ⚡ | ≥ 75% | bright green |
| 💡 | 50–74% | green |
| 💫 | 35–49% | yellow |
| 🌑 | < 35% | red |

### 2. Dynamic CHECK Threshold — `↕70%`

The Brier-calibrated **know** threshold the Sentinel requires for auto-proceed past CHECK. Arrow color signals **calibration health** (how much the Sentinel trusts your self-assessment):

| Color | Threshold inflation | Meaning |
|-------|--------------------|---------|
| green | ≤ 0.03 | Well-calibrated — threshold at baseline |
| yellow | ≤ 0.10 | Moderate miscalibration detected |
| red | > 0.10 | Significant miscalibration — Sentinel raises the bar |
| gray | — | Static fallback (no Brier data yet) |

The threshold rises as your predicted confidence diverges from actual outcomes. It falls back as calibration improves. **The number you see is what you need to hit in PREFLIGHT know to skip CHECK.**

### 3. Open Counts — `🎯0 ❓0`

`🎯N` = open goals. `❓N` = open unknowns. Color scales with count (green 0 → yellow moderate → red high).

If goal-linked blockers exist: `❓total/blockers` (e.g., `❓119/70` = 119 unresolved, 70 blocking goals).

### 4. Transaction Phase — `POST`

Current phase in the epistemic transaction:

| Label | Phase |
|-------|-------|
| `PRE` | PREFLIGHT — transaction opened, awaiting CHECK |
| `CHK` | CHECK — readiness gate |
| `POST` | POSTFLIGHT — transaction closed |

### 5. Phase Composite — `⚙82%`

Vector composite for the current phase. The emoji indicates work phase:

| Emoji | Phase | Vectors averaged |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 🔍 | noetic (investigating) | clarity, coherence, signal, density |
| ⚙ | praxic (acting) | state, change, completion, impact |
| — (at CHECK) | check-readiness gate | know, context, clarity, coherence, signal, density |

Color by value: green ≥ 75%, yellow ≥ 50%, red < 50%.

CHECK with a gate decision appends a transition indicator:
- `→` (green) — proceed was granted
- `…` (yellow) — investigate — more noetic work required

Example: `CHK 🔍82%→` means CHECK passed proceeding into praxic.

### 6. Raw Vectors — `K:80% C:85%`

Two of the 13 epistemic vectors shown in-line: `K` = know, `C` = context. These are your raw PREFLIGHT/CHECK values, not the composite. Color matches the phase-composite scheme.

In `learning` mode this expands to all five key vectors (`know`, `uncertainty`, `context`, `clarity`, `completion`).

### 7. POSTFLIGHT Deltas — `Δ ✓`

Only shown on POSTFLIGHT. Single-symbol summary of learning deltas across all vectors:

| Symbol | Meaning | Net delta |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `✓` (green) | Net positive learning | > +0.05 |
| `△` (white) | Neutral — no meaningful change | −0.05 to +0.05 |
| `⚠` (red) | Net negative — check what regressed | < −0.05 |

Sign convention: for `uncertainty`, *lower* is better (counted as positive delta). All other vectors: higher is better.

### 8. Context Window — `58%ctx`

Claude Code context window usage, passed via stdin. Color: green < 50%, yellow 50–80%, red ≥ 80%.

Useful for deciding when to compact. The statusline also persists this percentage to `~/.empirica/context_usage.json` so UserPromptSubmit hooks can read it (hooks don't receive `context_window` directly).

---

## Edge States

When there's no normal session to display, the statusline shows one of these:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `[empirica] OFF-RECORD` | Sentinel paused (`~/.empirica/sentinel_paused` exists). Measurements not being taken. |
| `[empirica] OFF-RECORD (Nm ago)` | Same, with time since pause |
| `[no project]` | No `.empirica/project.yaml` found — not in an Empirica project |
| `[project:inactive]` | In a project, but no active session (`empirica session-create` hasn't run) |

If you see **nothing at all**, the script didn't run. Check Claude Code statusline settings, or run the script manually:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/plugins/local/empirica/scripts/statusline_empirica.py < /dev/null
```

---

## Extensions

External packages can inject their own labels. Write a JSON file to `~/.empirica/statusline_ext/<name>.json`:

```json
{"label": "WS:4", "color": "cyan"}
```

The statusline reads every `*.json` in that directory and appends the labels (cyan by default) to the header. This is how `empirica-workspace` adds workspace counts, for example.

## Full Mode Example

```
[empirica:claude-code@3d0f] auth-f (2/5) ⚡83% ↕70% │ 🎯1 ❓3 │ POST ⚙82% │ K:80% U:20% C:85% D:75% Co:70% │ Δ ✓
```

- `[project:ai@sid]` — project label, AI ID, 4-char session ID prefix
- `auth-f (2/5)` — active goal (truncated to 12 chars) with subtask progress
- All vectors shown with 2-letter labels (`K`, `U`, `C`, `D`, `Co`, …)

---

## Full Mode Glyphs (Legacy Moon Phases)

In some legacy paths and debug output you may see moon-phase confidence emojis from the shared `empirica/core/signaling.py` module (`🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘 🌑`). These map roughly to the ⚡/💡/💫/🌑 tiers in the default statusline. The default mode uses the tiered power-emoji variant because it's more familiar; moon phases are retained in `full` for compatibility with older workflow docs.

## Environment Variables

| Var | Values | Default | Effect |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| `EMPIRICA_STATUS_MODE` | `basic` \| `default` \| `learning` \| `full` | `default` | Mode selector |
| `EMPIRICA_AI_ID` | any string | `claude-code` | Which AI's session to render |
| `EMPIRICA_SIGNALING_LEVEL` | `basic` \| `default` \| `full` | `default` | Signaling module verbosity |

## Common Questions

**"Why does ↕ show 70% when my know is at 85%?"**
The threshold (↕) is what the Sentinel requires, not your current value. 85% know against 70% threshold means you're above the bar and can auto-proceed past CHECK.

**"Why is `Δ` missing from my statusline?"**
`Δ` only renders on POSTFLIGHT (when deltas are computed). During PREFLIGHT / CHECK there's no learning delta to show yet.

**"Why does the phase composite differ from confidence?"**
Confidence is a weighted global score across 4 vectors. Phase composite averages a *different* subset per phase — noetic (clarity/coherence/signal/density) or praxic (state/change/completion/impact). They measure different things on purpose.

**"I see `OFF-RECORD` — how do I turn the sentinel back on?"**

```bash
rm ~/.empirica/sentinel_paused
```

**"Can I customize the glyphs?"**
Not via config currently — emoji and colors are hard-coded in `statusline_empirica.py`. Patches welcome.
