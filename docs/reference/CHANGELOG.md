## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Temporal Entity Model** — Codebase entities (functions, classes, APIs, imports) tracked with temporal validity windows. Auto-extracted from file edits via PostToolUse hook, queried during CHECK for codebase-aware gating, and used as grounded calibration evidence. Inspired by and adapted from [world-model-mcp](https://github.com/SaravananJaichandar/world-model-mcp) (MIT license) — thank you to Saravanan Jaichandar for the foundational work on structured codebase knowledge graphs.
  - New tables: `codebase_entities`, `codebase_facts`, `codebase_relationships`, `codebase_constraints` (migration 033)
  - New module: `empirica/core/codebase_model/` (extractor.py, types.py)
  - New repository: `CodebaseModelRepository` with entity/fact/relationship/constraint CRUD
  - Language-aware extraction: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, Shell
  - PostToolUse hook: `entity-extractor.py` — automatic extraction after Edit/Write tool calls
  - CHECK enrichment: `codebase_context` field with active entity count and constraints
  - Grounded calibration: `codebase_model` evidence source (entities_discovered, facts_created, convention_constraints)

- **MCP Server: 102 tools** — Added 45 new tools (12 Tier 1 + 33 Tier 2) covering lessons, investigations, assessments, agents, personas, and memory subsystems. Enriched 6 logging tools with entity linking params. Fixed stdin inheritance bug that caused postflight-submit to hang in stdio mode.

### Fixed
- **MCP stdin hang** — `subprocess.run()` without `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` caused CLI commands to block on MCP's protocol stdin stream. Fixes postflight/preflight hanging indefinitely.
- **MCP `mistake_log` routing** — Enriched tool was missing from `tool_map`, generating invalid CLI command
- **MCP `arg_map` duplicate** — Shadowed `goal_id` key removed
- **MCP `json_supported` gaps** — Added 23 missing CLI commands, removed 2 orphan entries
- **handoff-create variable scope bug** — `next_session_context` was unbound in legacy CLI mode
- **handoff-create JSON parse error** — `json.loads()` on empty strings; now uses `parse_json_safely()`
- **project-bootstrap NoneType comparison** — Delta values from missing vectors now guarded against None
- **goals-discover test timeout** — Increased from 5s to 30s for repos with large goal sets (800+)
- **test_complete_cascade_workflow** — Fixed assertions to match current PREFLIGHT response format

## [1.5.10] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Phase-Weighted Holistic Calibration** - Sentinel splits tool counts into `noetic_tool_calls` / `praxic_tool_calls`. POSTFLIGHT computes holistic calibration score weighted by actual phase distribution. Pure research transactions no longer penalized on praxic grounding.
- **Calibration Insights Loop** - New `CalibrationInsightsAnalyzer` detects systemic patterns (chronic bias, evidence gaps, phase mismatch, volatile vectors) across verification history. Insights stored in `calibration_insights` table and exported to `.breadcrumbs.yaml`.
- **Web Evidence Profile** - New `WebEvidenceCollector` with 5 evidence sources: build verification, HTML validation, link integrity, terminology consistency, asset verification.

## [1.5.6] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Entity Scoping** - `--entity-type`, `--entity-id`, `--via` flags on all artifact commands

### Fixed
- **Auto-Derive session_id** - `postflight-submit` and `preflight-submit` auto-derive from active transaction
- **Postflight Project Resolution** - Canonical project resolution instead of CWD fallback
- **Entity artifact_source** - Uses `trajectory_path` for correct entity artifact sourcing
- **Sentinel INVESTIGATE Gaming** - Blocks gaming via new transaction creation

### Changed
- **Onboarding Rewrite** - Complete rewrite with current capabilities
- **Documentation Overhaul** - Updated all end-user and developer docs to current syntax

## [1.5.5] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Schema Migration Ordering** (#44) - `CREATE INDEX` on `transaction_id` now runs after migrations with `column_exists()` guards
- **Qdrant File-Based Fallback Removed** (#45) - Returns `None` when no server available; 36 call sites guarded
- **project-embed Path Resolution** (#46) - Resolves `sessions.db` from workspace.db trajectory_path
- **transaction-adopt Same-Instance** (#44) - Skips rename when `from_instance == to_instance`
- **Instance Isolation: Closed Transactions as Anchors** - Persist until next PREFLIGHT for post-compact resolution
- **Lessons Storage Fallback** - Server check instead of file-based storage

## [1.5.4] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Autonomy Calibration Loop, Subagent Governance, CASCADE Exemption
- Auto-PREFLIGHT on project-switch, Lifecycle Cleanup
- Release Pipeline: empirica-mcp build/publish

- 3,220 calibration observations

### Changed
- POSTFLIGHT now triggers automatic grounded verification
- MCP `get_calibration_report` returns `grounded_verification` field

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-21 - Epistemic-First Model

### Added
- **calibration-report CLI command** - Analyze AI self-assessment calibration using vector_trajectories
  - Measures gap from expected at session END (1.0 for most vectors, 0.0 for uncertainty)
  - Outputs per-vector bias corrections, sample sizes, trends
  - Supports human/json/markdown output formats
  - Usage: `empirica calibration-report [--weeks N] [--output FORMAT]`

- **CHECK phase epistemic snapshots** - CHECK now captures to epistemic_snapshots table
  - Previously only POSTFLIGHT was captured
  - Enables richer calibration analysis with intermediate CHECK data points

### Changed
- **Sentinel CHECK expiry now opt-in** (EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_CHECK_EXPIRY)
  - Previously: 30-minute expiry was always enforced
  - Now: Disabled by default - users may pause sessions and resume later
  - Enable with: `export EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_CHECK_EXPIRY=true`

### Fixed
- **Sentinel timestamp parsing** - Now handles both ISO format and Unix timestamps from SQLite
  - Previously failed on Unix float timestamps, defaulting to 999 minutes (always expired)

### Removed
- **sentinel-gate-minimal.py** - Consolidated into main sentinel-gate.py

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Vector-based cognitive phase inference** (commit 768bc75d)
  - Cognitive phase (NOETIC/THRESHOLD/PRAXIC) now inferred from vectors
  - Implements Turtle Principle: phase is OBSERVED, not prescribed
  - New `CognitivePhase` enum in `empirica/core/signaling.py`
  - `infer_cognitive_phase_from_vectors()` using readiness + action metrics
  - Statusline shows both emergent phase AND CASCADE gate
  - Documented in `docs/architecture/NOETIC_PRAXIC_FRAMEWORK.md`

### Phase 4 (In Progress)
- Documentation completion
- End-to-end testing
- PyPI package preparation
- Release v1.0.0

---

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-11 - Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **Git notes creation failure** (commit daff2801)
  - Problem: Git notes failing with "error: there was a problem with the editor"
  - Root cause: Missing `-F -` flag in subprocess commands
  - Solution: Added `-F -` to tell git to read from stdin
  - Impact: All 3 storage layers (SQLite + Git Notes + JSON) now working correctly
  - Files: `empirica/core/canonical/git_enhanced_reflex_logger.py` (lines 613, 698)

- **Memory gap false positives** (commits 7e39c2e8, 5fa2fbe5, 2a625277)
  - Problem 1: Uncertainty decrease incorrectly flagged as memory loss
  - Reality: Uncertainty decrease = learning, not forgetting (inverse vector)
  - Problem 2: Within-session PREFLIGHT→POSTFLIGHT decreases flagged as "memory gaps"
  - Reality: These are calibration corrections ("I thought I knew, but I don't"), not memory compression
  - Solution: Removed false memory gap detection entirely
  - Note: True memory gap detection requires cross-session comparison (previous POSTFLIGHT → current PREFLIGHT)
  - Files: `empirica/cli/command_handlers/workflow_commands.py`

- **POSTFLIGHT anchoring bias** (commit cb0c15d7)
  - Problem: `execute_postflight` MCP tool showed PREFLIGHT baseline vectors to AI during assessment
  - Risk: Anchoring bias - AI adjusts assessment based on remembered baseline instead of genuine reflection
  - Solution: Removed `preflight_baseline.vectors` from MCP response, kept contextual info only
  - Impact: True pure self-assessment - AI assesses current state without bias, system calculates deltas objectively
  - Philosophy: Genuine self-assessment requires removing cognitive biases
  - Files: `mcp_local/empirica_mcp_server.py`

### Added
- **Artifacts tracking in project-bootstrap** (commit 652db142)
  - Feature: `project-bootstrap` now surfaces recently modified files from handoff reports
  - Returns: `recent_artifacts` with last 10 sessions' file modifications
  - Use case: Systematic documentation auditing - compare modified files vs reference docs vs git history
  - Files: `empirica/data/session_database.py`, `empirica/cli/command_handlers/project_commands.py`
