"""
Tests for the meta uncertainty gate semantic.

Background (2026-04-07):
The Sentinel CHECK gate previously required (know >= 0.70 AND uncertainty <= 0.35).
The know condition was 'based on vibes' per David and made the gate gameable —
an AI could inflate know to bypass while uncertainty drifted high.

Per the meta-uncertainty design, uncertainty IS the unified confidence summary
that subsumes the AI's epistemic state across all 12 other vectors. The gate
should use ONLY meta uncertainty as the threshold:

  proceed if uncertainty <= ready_uncertainty_threshold

Gaming resistance: an AI that inflates other vectors but reports low
uncertainty passes the gate, but the POSTFLIGHT meta-uncertainty derivation
(mapper.py:_compute_meta_uncertainty) compares the self-reported uncertainty
to a value computed from gap magnitudes of the OTHER grounded vectors.
Inflation produces large gaps which produce high meta-uncertainty which
produces a large divergence which surfaces in calibration_trajectory and
overestimate_tendency. Honest measurement is recovered post-hoc.

These tests lock in the new gate semantic by inspecting the source files
where the gate logic lives.
